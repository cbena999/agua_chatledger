The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now prioritizing precise tool selection based on updated rules to avoid inefficient methods. Remembering instructions 1 and 2, I'm carefully listing related tools before any tool calls. I suspect the current image mismatch might be due to a previous assistant's change or missing context and am now investigating the git history or considering an image replacement.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm now focusing on tool selection, emphasizing specific tools over general ones where possible. The goal is to optimize efficiency by leveraging tools tailored to particular tasks, like viewing files. This strategy promises a more targeted and less error-prone approach to problem-solving, which I will continue to refine and implement moving forward.

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now implementing strict rules regarding tool selection, particularly avoiding `cat` for file manipulation and `grep` inside bash. I am prioritizing specialized tools. I've also incorporated a "pre-flight" checklist, requiring me to explicitly consider all potential tools before making a final selection and using them. I will apply these new principles to the file editing task, always starting by remembering my critical instructions.


**Initiating Image Modification**

I'm now directing my focus toward image manipulation, specifically utilizing the `generate_image` tool for editing. The input is `02mapa-laesh.webp`, and the prompt will be: "Edit the provided map image. Completely remove the uneven lilac/purple line in the corner. In its place, draw a green icon with the letters 'CFE' inside it. Keep the rest of the map exactly the same as the original." My initial concern was hallucinations, but I think `generate_image` is the only appropriate tool for the task. I will backup the input image before proceeding, to protect the source.

## Agent Response

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Analyzing Tool Selection**

I'm now prioritizing tool selection based on new constraints. I'm actively avoiding `cat`, `grep` and `ls`, and `sed` for tasks. I am recalling the critical instruction, and I'm generating a list of potentially useful tools before executing the request for the image edit.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now emphasizing stricter tool selection rules, especially avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending and promoting `grep_search`. I'm also ensuring a checklist of related tools before execution, prioritising the most specific. Moreover, I updated an image to fix a text overlap. I have successfully overwritten the current `02mapa-`.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm now focusing on tool selection, emphasizing specific tools over general ones where possible. The goal is to optimize efficiency by leveraging tools like 'view_file' directly, rather than resorting to broader, less direct methods. I'm aiming for targeted actions.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now implementing strict rules regarding tool selection, particularly avoiding `cat` for file manipulation and `grep` inside bash. Before invoking any tool, I explicitly list related tools to ensure the most appropriate one is chosen. The current task involves addressing an artifact in an image. I'll use `generate_image` to create a new image, starting from the original backup and adding a discreet icon.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm now focusing on tool selection, emphasizing specific tools over general ones where possible. The goal is to optimize efficiency by leveraging tools like 'view_file' directly, rather than resorting to broader, less direct methods. I'm aiming for targeted actions.


**Refining Tool Choice**

I'm now zeroing in on refined tool selection, remembering to avoid unnecessary commands like `cat` and `grep` within bash. I'm focusing on direct tool usage, always considering the available tools and their specific capabilities before making a call. My approach prioritizes precision and minimizing indirect methods. I'm now thinking about how to handle the new image provided and the instruction to add a stylized green icon.

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. Remembering my instructions, I'm avoiding 'cat' for file manipulation and 'ls' for file browsing. I'm prioritizing `grep_search` and `sed` appropriately. My focus is now on the most efficient tool for image resizing - considering the context of a previous large image. I think I will use the function `generate_image`.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Choices**

I'm now zeroing in on optimizing tool selection based on those critical instructions, particularly avoiding `cat` for file manipulation and internal `grep` commands. I'm focusing on starting each thought with instruction reminders. The user wants to apply a green icon to cover the `x=43-241, y=177-414` lilac line, but also requested to reduce the icon size.


**Analyzing Image Solutions**

I've realized the AI cropped the image, zooming in on a section and losing the aspect ratio. This won't work for generating a small icon to overlay a large line. I'm considering using OpenCV to extract and scale the CFE icon from the 1024x1024 output, as this is more likely to give the right result. I may need to use generate_image to find a version with better aspect ratio control.

You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Choices**

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. I'm actively avoiding redundant tool usage, like using `cat` when a simpler method exists. Explicitly listing relevant tools before making a call is helping. Focusing on creating a stylized green icon is the current goal, by potentially extracting it from a source image, instead of relying on default PIL functionality.


**Analyzing Image Transformations**

I'm now examining how the AI image generation cropped to a square. I need to figure out how to best extract the stylized green icon from the cropped image, which has a rectangular background, or the original. Generating a new image is not optimal since it only produces a square icon, with distorted dimensions from the rectangular source. The `v2` image has the correct size, but the map is oddly cropped. This is where I am focused now.

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now prioritizing direct tool usage based on specific commands, following the outlined rules. I'm focusing on avoiding indirect calls and prioritizing tools like `grep_search`. I'm also preparing for the next step, I'm thinking about making a stylized icon using PIL and considering rounded rectangles and shadows. I've begun to load a backup map.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now prioritizing adhering to very specific tool usage rules to increase effectiveness, such as *never* using `cat` for file creation/appending and always using `grep_search` instead of `grep` within bash commands unless absolutely necessary. Before calling tools, I need to list *all* related tools. I am currently focusing on editing `index.html` to replace `mapa-laesh.webp` with `01mapa-laesh.webp`.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now implementing strict rules regarding tool selection, particularly avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending, and `grep` within bash unless necessary. I am also making sure to list related tools before executing, as per critical instructions. Based on new input, I'm considering using `generate_image` directly on the provided map, as it's an AI model which may be able to *see* the image.


**Analyzing Image Dimensions**

I've realized a potential issue with `generate_image`: its tendency to crop images to 1024x1024. The current map, `02mapa-laesh.webp`, is smaller, which means my instructions could be ignored by the image generation model. I am thinking I need to find a way to pad the image, but still think the text placement should be done via Python. I need to find the red line's location and angle first.

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. I'm actively avoiding redundant tool usage, like using `cat` when a simpler method exists. It's about optimizing commands by listing all tools related to a task before executing any of them. The "one pure red pixel" constraint is guiding this process. I will try the `generate_image` tool.


**Investigating Image Dimensions**

I'm now investigating DALL-E 3's image size capabilities within the `generate_image` tool. I need to see if it preserves aspect ratios or enforces square outputs, specifically, does it respect 656x477 dimensions? I've confirmed the tool's schema limits input images to three. My plan is to use DALL-E to draw over an existing image, and I think I can use template matching to solve this. I'll test it out!

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now prioritizing tool selection with increased rigor, adhering strictly to the new rules I've established. Specifically, I'm avoiding `cat` for file creation and `grep` within bash commands unless necessary. I'm focusing on explicit tool listing, thinking through options before execution to enhance effectiveness and ensure the ideal tool is utilized. The map size issue is still a problem; I'll need to figure out an approach to get around the cropping.


**Analyzing Image Transformations**

I've shifted focus to image transformations. The cropped map is the immediate priority, and I've ruled out simple resizing. OpenCV's homography is a viable solution, offering a way to warp the cropped image. Alternatively, Python/Pillow text drawing may work if I can't find a homography. Ultimately, I want to preserve the AI's "modern outline."


**Implementing Homography Alignment**

I'm now fully committed to the OpenCV approach. With `cv2.findHomography` and ORB features, I can perfectly align the generated image back onto the original map. My new script will load both images, convert to grayscale, find ORB features, match descriptors, and calculate the homography matrix to warp and blend. The blending method, however, is flexible; I may isolate and blend the green text or just overwrite if hallucination is minimal. Perhaps I will just use PIL to draw rotated text!

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now deeply focused on adhering to strict tool selection rules. Remembering Critical Instructions 1 and 2, I'm trying to avoid `cat` in bash commands, and leaning heavily on `grep_search` and other specialized tools. Also, I realized that I need to be more mindful of the specific task and associated tools prior to execution. Considering the image analysis, I understand the green threshold is too simple. The CFE text can't be isolated by this metric, so I need another plan. The target image is, surprisingly, from the initial user request.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. Critical Instructions 1 and 2 are paramount. I'm actively avoiding redundant commands. I recall the image dimensions, 656x477, previously modified via a Python script. Based on the user feedback, I have a good understanding of what the user wants. The icon design appears to be satisfactory.


**Adjusting Visual Placement**

Now I'm focusing on the exact placement of the "CFE" icon. The user wants the green, tilted text, which was on the second map, moved to the first map ("01mapa-laesh.webp"). Crucially, I must remove the lilac line and put the icon there, as instructed. I'm verifying the image's intended dimensions and aspect ratio to ensure the text fits correctly.


**Revising Icon Implementation**

I'm now changing my plan for incorporating the "CFE" icon. I had been concerned about extracting the icon, and now I realized that drawing it using Python's PIL (Pillow) is much simpler and offers far more control. I can easily manage the font, color, and tilt. The goal is to make it visually attractive and accurate, and it's simpler to manage this through a drawing tool than through image manipulation. I'll use DejaVuSans-Bold for the font.

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now zeroing in on stricter rules for tool selection, especially avoiding `cat` and `grep` within bash commands unless necessary. I'm focusing on always listing out related tools before making calls, ensuring that I use only the most direct and efficient method. I need to be more mindful of input errors, specifically ensuring the file name exists and is correct.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection criteria as I'm thinking. Remembering the rules, especially about avoiding `cat` and nested commands, is key. I'm focusing on pre-planning the tools required, ensuring I explicitly list them before any execution. Understanding that the lilac line was in the file `01mapa-laesh.webp`, has corrected previous misinformation, meaning the focus of attention changes to that file.

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

**Refining Style Replication**

I'm now zeroing in on replicating the style and position of text within an image. It seems the user wants `01mapa-laesh.webp` to mimic `02mapa-laesh.webp`. Crucially, I must remember the OpenCV homography fix applied to `02mapa-laesh.webp`, ensuring it's the current reference for style and text positioning. This means recreating the CFE text from the first image with the corrected position and style from the second.

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now prioritizing adhering to very specific tool usage rules to increase effectiveness, by following instructions explicitly. I aim to avoid `cat` or `grep` within bash commands and prefer dedicated utilities. The `cv2.seamlessClone` function worked great, successfully extracting and blending a region, with the bounding box `x=150-295`, `y=128-343`, from one image onto another.
