### USER Objective:
Stabilizing Agua Financial Saneamiento

The user's objective is to stabilize the Agua web application by refactoring contract status logic and implementing a robust, web-based financial saneamiento system. Key goals include:
1. Implementing defensive coding to enforce logical contract state transitions and prevent "Avalancha Punitiva" and "Deuda Zombi".
2. Developing a centralized, parameter-driven administrative dashboard (`admin/saneamiento/`) for historical data cleanup (2018-2026), specifically targeting "Cargos Fantasma".
3. Ensuring all saneamiento operations include audit trails and rollback capabilities via a new `batch_id` column to maintain fiscal integrity during the migration to the V2 schema.
4. Organizing project assets and infrastructure within a dedicated `feature/saneamiento-v2` branch to ensure consistency with Host C migration requirements while maintaining a clean, modular codebase.

### Thinking

**Analyzing the Bug**

I've pinpointed a bug in the contract management view, specifically within the annotation system. When adding a new annotation, it’s currently rendering twice in the dropdown list, which is not intended behavior. This duplication needs immediate resolution. I'm focusing on debugging the rendering logic for the annotation list.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time. The exception is if the task is trivially simple.
2. After your research is complete, ask the user any open questions using the ask_question tool. Don't use the tool to ask trivial questions like 'should I proceed?'.
3. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true`. The user must approve the plan before you are allowed to proceed.
4. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
5. Verify any work that you have done.
6. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

### Thinking

**Analyzing Note Forms**

I've been analyzing the note form within `views/contratos/ficha.php`. Specifically, lines 263-272 contain the HTML for adding a note. I see the form is initially hidden, but it seems well-structured, although more investigation is needed to evaluate its functionality. I will also be reviewing the file's corresponding functionality and any accompanying JavaScript files.


**Investigating Form Submission**

I've traced the note form's submission details. The form, `agregarNota`, targets `paxscript.js` for handling. The hidden inputs set `opc` to `agregaNota` and pass the contract `id`. I've also identified where existing notes are displayed, which is lines 1-15, inside the `ficha.php` view. It uses a `<ul>` list and iterates through notes to display them.

You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time. The exception is if the task is trivially simple.
2. After your research is complete, ask the user any open questions using the ask_question tool. Don't use the tool to ask trivial questions like 'should I proceed?'.
3. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true`. The user must approve the plan before you are allowed to proceed.
4. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
5. Verify any work that you have done.
6. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.

### Thinking

**Analyzing Double Registrations**

I've pinpointed duplicate registrations for `#agregarNota` within `paxscript.js`. Specifically, lines 152-153 of `guardaDatosContrato` contain an unbind-submit sequence targeting this element. This potentially leads to unintended multiple submissions. I'm focusing on the implications of these double-binds, and how they might impact the application's behavior.

<summary>System Message</summary>

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time. The exception is if the task is trivially simple.
2. After your research is complete, ask the user any open questions using the ask_question tool. Don't use the tool to ask trivial questions like 'should I proceed?'.
3. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true`. The user must approve the plan before you are allowed to proceed.
4. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
5. Verify any work that you have done.
6. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time. The exception is if the task is trivially simple.
2. After your research is complete, ask the user any open questions using the ask_question tool. Don't use the tool to ask trivial questions like 'should I proceed?'.
3. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true`. The user must approve the plan before you are allowed to proceed.
4. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
5. Verify any work that you have done.
6. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.

## Agent Response

### Thinking

**Analyzing Function 'creaNota'**

I'm currently focusing on the `creaNota` function, specifically lines 285-303. I've noted its parameters and the database connection it establishes. I'm paying close attention to the comment at line 291. It signals a potential fix related to a "numcontratoresp" value that needs to be implemented correctly during insertion.


**Examining Return Values**

I've shifted my attention to the return value of `creaNota`. It's returning a script that calls `cargaDatosContrato('$contrato')`. I've traced that function's AJAX call in `paxscript.js` to the `ruteador.php` and then, to the 'cargaContrato' option, which loads `contratos/ficha` within the '#app' div. This connection will provide deeper insight into the data flow.


**Tracing Data Flow Further**

I'm now tracing the data flow within the `contratos/ficha` template. I've pinpointed that `guardaDatosContrato()` is triggered upon submission of `#agregarNota`. The `ajaxSubmit` call is configured to send the form data to `ruteador.php`. Interestingly, the success handler then updates `#realizaranotacion` with the result from `creaNota`, which is a script that reloads the contract view. I'm now contemplating why the entire view is reloaded. Could there be an issue that causes multiple insertions? Or perhaps there is an unnecessary double call.

# Regla 06: Accesos, Rutas y Herramientas (A/B/C)

Esta regla consolida los accesos a los tres ambientes de **Agua** y define cuándo usar MCP vs CLI MySQL.

---

## Host A — Linux XAMPP (Desarrollo / Próximo Producción)

| Recurso | Ruta / Credencial |
|---------|-------------------|
| **XAMPP Home** | `/opt/lampp` |
| **PHP Bin** | `/opt/lampp/bin/php` |
| **MySQL Bin** | `/opt/lampp/bin/mysql` |
| **Source Code** | `/opt/lampp/htdocs/agua` |
| **Web URL** | `http://localhost/agua/login/index2.php` |
| **Web User / Pass** | `nancy` / `260180` |
| **MySQL** | `127.0.0.1:3306` · user `root` · pass `comite_2026` · db `awa` |
| **MCP** | `bdawahost-a` |

## Host B — Windows 7 MySQL legado (Solo lectura — datos frescos)

| Recurso | Valor |
|---------|-------|
| **MySQL** | `192.168.1.120:3306` · user `root` · pass `sdrastbuy` · db `awa` |
| **MCP** | `bdawahost-b` |

## Host C — Windows 10 XAMPP Portable 7.4.33 (V2 MariaDB)

| Recurso | Valor |
|---------|-------|
| **Web URL** | `http://192.168.1.128:7001/agua` |
| **Apache** | puerto `7001` |
| **MariaDB** | `192.168.1.128:7002` · user `root` · pass `comite_2026` · db `awa` |
| **MCP** | `bdawahost-c` |
| **XAMPP dir** | `F:\xampp` · Webapp: `F:\xampp\htdocs\agua` |

> **Puerto no estándar (7002):** El MCP de Host C requiere el patch de `entrypoint-patch.sh`
> aplicado al contenedor Docker `context7-mcp-mysql`. Sin el patch, `@f4ww4z/mcp-mysql-server`
> ignora el puerto de la URL y falla con ETIMEDOUT.
> Ver: `docs-dev/ga-cl-ia/issue-mcp-mysql-port-no-estandar.md`

---

## Arquitectura MCP — Docker context7-mcp-mysql

Los tres MCPs comparten **un solo contenedor Docker** con patches aplicados al arrancar:

```bash
# Estructura de cada MCP en .mcp.json
docker exec -i context7-mcp-mysql npx -y @f4ww4z/mcp-mysql-server mysql://user:pass@host:PORT/db
```

- Contenedor: `context7-mcp-mysql` (imagen `mcp/context7:latest`)
- Compose: `docs-dev/ga-cl-ia/docker-compose.yml`
- Patch: `docs-dev/ga-cl-ia/entrypoint-patch.sh` (soporte puerto no estándar — idempotente)
- Config activa: `.mcp.json` (symlink → `.chatledger/.mcp.json`)

> **NUNCA eliminar `.mcp.json`** ni reemplazar `docker exec` por `npx` directo.
> `mcp_config.json` en `.agents/` es la fuente de verdad de referencia — `.mcp.json` debe ser idéntico.

---

## Regla: MCP vs CLI MySQL

| Operación | Herramienta | Razón |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Diagnóstico, validación, queries ad-hoc, comparación entre hosts | **MCP** | Resultados en contexto, ejecutable en paralelo, sin parseo de terminal |
| Scripts con `DELIMITER`, stored procedures, triggers | **CLI MySQL** | MCP no soporta `DELIMITER` |
| Dumps, cargas masivas, migraciones de volumen | **CLI MySQL** | Más eficiente para operaciones de volumen |
| MCP no disponible o contenedor Docker caído | **CLI MySQL** | Fallback |

**Regla general**: Usar MCP para todo trabajo de diagnóstico e inspección. Recurrir a CLI solo cuando la operación lo requiera explícitamente.

CLI Host A: `/opt/lampp/bin/mysql -u root -pcomite_2026 awa`
CLI Host C (desde Host A): `/opt/lampp/bin/mysql -h 192.168.1.128 -P 7002 -u root -pcomite_2026 awa`

---
**Nota**: Cualquier script de automatización que requiera ejecución directa de PHP o MySQL debe referenciar los binarios en `/opt/lampp/bin/` para compatibilidad con el stack legado.

**Investigating Connection Refusal**

I'm currently trying to connect to the MariaDB instance at `127.0.0.1:3306`, and the MCP `bdawahost-a` is my intended tool. However, I've hit a `ECONNREFUSED` error. It's likely that I need to verify that the database is running on the specified port. I am considering the use of `localhost` as an alternative, too.

### Thinking

**Identifying Data Duplicates**

I've pinpointed duplicate entries in the database. Specifically, `id: 3756` and `3755` share the same `texto` and `fecha` values, and similarly, `id: 3754` and `3753` also present identical data points. This duplication warrants further investigation.


**Analyzing Submit Handler**

I've confirmed a double `INSERT` and am now tracking it down. I examined `paxscript.js`, specifically the `#agregarNota` submit handler. Initially, I thought multiple bindings might be the culprit, but the `.unbind('submit')` in both instances should prevent that. I did, however, notice duplicate validation blocks for `#datoscto`. The submit button, with the class `anotacioncto` seems relevant now.


**Investigating Double Trigger**

I'm now suspecting a double trigger from an unexpected source, after looking carefully at `paxscript.js`. It looks like both the original submit handler and the `cargaDatosContrato` success block define their own, potentially redundant submit handlers for `#agregarNota`. Specifically, lines 152 and 292 appear to bind the event. I need to figure out which is the root cause.


**Tracing the Execution Path**

I've traced the execution path triggered when loading `ficha.php`. The immediate execution of `guardaDatosContrato()` after the HTML addition *does* bind `#agregarNota`. The success callback from `cargaDatosContrato` also re-binds, even though it unbinds first, and this is where it gets confusing! The submit handler, however, is not the culprit. Now I am checking whether the `anotacioncto` class is bound to any explicit click events elsewhere.


**Unraveling Event Bindings**

I'm starting to think `ajaxSubmit` might be implicitly binding to the form submission. I also need to verify if `guardaDatosContrato` gets called more than once. The line numbers line up well to `paxscript.js`, and its interactions with `ficha.php`. It looks like I was wrong about the submit handler causing the double trigger, and there may be a click event triggering this. I also checked `ruteador.php` and `creaNota` but found nothing to help, but maybe the button has an implicit submit that submits the form.


**Uncovering Parallel Requests**

I've made a breakthrough. Examining database insertion timestamps reveals consecutive IDs with identical times, pointing to simultaneous or near-simultaneous calls to `ruteador.php`. I'm now exploring `paxscript.js` for additional submit or generic event handlers to confirm the parallel request hypothesis. The duplicate validation blocks I saw earlier are irrelevant to the current issue, focusing now on identifying the source of these concurrent calls.


**Confirming Order of Execution**

I've clarified the execution order when `cargaDatosContrato` is involved. The key is now clear. The crucial point is that when `cargaDatosContrato` loads HTML into the DOM, the embedded `<script>guardaDatosContrato()</script>` executes BEFORE the `cargaDatosContrato`'s success callback. This means the form binding inside `guardaDatosContrato` is set up first, and then *again* by the success callback, creating a double binding effect.

### Thinking

**Pinpointing the Root Cause**

I've isolated the core issue: duplicate entries in the `notas` table. The `guardaDatosContrato` function, called after `ficha.php` loads, appears responsible. Further, `cargaDatosContrato` seems intertwined as it handles loading success. I believe I need to dissect the interaction between these functions more carefully.


**Analyzing the Double Bind**

I've been examining the submit event bindings on `#agregarNota`. Although `unbind('submit')` is used, I now realize it might not completely prevent duplicate submissions due to how `ajaxSubmit` might handle bindings internally. A key observation: both `guardaDatosContrato` and `cargaDatosContrato` use `async: false`, which is deprecated and could create synchronization problems. This is the most likely culprit, I think.


**Unraveling the Bindings**

I'm now focusing on the double-binding of the form within both `guardaDatosContrato` and `cargaDatosContrato`. It seems that the latter function rebinds after completion. While `unbind('submit')` should prevent duplicates, the form's dual submission, potentially via button click and form submit, is suspected. Further analysis of `creaNota` revealed that it's re-triggering `cargaDatosContrato` with a script tag, which then, in turn, re-renders the complete form, including the call to `guardaDatosContrato`. This cycle seems broken, and my goal is to isolate the specific binding causing this continuous loop.


**Isolating the Root Cause**

I'm now focusing on eliminating duplicate entries. Removing the submit binding from `cargaDatosContrato` seems like the next logical step; the form should function via `guardaDatosContrato` called in the HTML. I've noted "aparece dos veces en la ceja desplegable," pointing to a database duplication. The `submit` event bubbling is a potential cause. Also, I've noted inconsistencies in the use of `$(form).ajaxSubmit(opciones)` versus `$(this).ajaxSubmit(opciones)`, so I'll see if that has relevance. Analyzing `paxscript.js`, I found rebinding in `cargaDatosContrato`, specifically lines 292-295, where `$('#agregarNota')` is rebound on success, which means my initial focus on `guardaDatosContrato` and `ficha.php` was incomplete.


**Refining the Submission Logic**

I've discovered a new lead! The direct call to `guardaDatosContrato()` within the `<script>` tag inserted by `ficha.php` and the subsequent rebinding in `paxscript.js` line 292 might be redundant. While I still don't see an `onsubmit` in the HTML, the key observation is that *both* calls use `$(form).ajaxSubmit(opciones)`. This suggests that the form is being submitted twice, although this is NOT due to a double click. The first AJAX call is asynchronous, but the second may be synchronous. This is the new key focus.


**Confirming the Duplication Loop**

I've made a crucial breakthrough! Examining `creaNota` reveals the source of the double submission: a `<script>` tag calls `cargaDatosContrato` after the initial form submission. This, in turn, reloads the form and calls the `guardaDatosContrato` function a second time, triggering another submission. I'm now certain this cascading effect explains the duplicate entries.


**Eliminating the Redundancy**

I'm now focusing on the redundant bindings of the `#agregarNota` form, specifically where `guardaDatosContrato` and `cargaDatosContrato` both interact. The observation that IDs 3755 and 3756 were inserted at the same second is critical. My hypothesis is that jQuery's `ajaxSubmit` might be internally re-binding to the form. The use of `async: false` in `cargaDatosContrato` further raises concerns, because after `$("#app").html(msg)` it continues to re-bind many things.

### Thinking

**Confirming Duplicate Entries**

I've pinpointed the double insertion issue to the database. It seems like the dual binding, potentially compounded by the use of `async: false` or execution sequence, is the culprit. Specifically, the function `guardaDatosContrato` is triggered both by a `<script>` tag within the HTML and again through the `cargaDatosContrato` bindings.


**Analyzing Binding Issues**

I've discovered that `#agregarNota` is unbound and re-bound in two separate sections, but with different `opciones` instances. I see that `opciones3` is used in `cargaDatosContrato` and a local `opciones` variable is in `guardaDatosContrato`. If I fix the binding, it should solve the double entry issue. I've also spotted widespread use of `async: false`, which I will address as it is problematic. I'm making a plan to clean `paxscript.js`, ensure only one binding, remove `async: false` and fix the double insertion bug. I see a submit event is bound with `unbind` and `submit`!

### Thinking

**Analyzing the Duplicate**

I've confirmed the duplication across all recent notes – NOTA 1 through nota 4, and it appears to be systemic. My current plan involves addressing redundant event bindings within the `cargaDatosContrato` success callback in `paxscript.js`. The existing HTML is already handling some of these bindings through `gu`, so I will remove the duplicate code.

**Verifying Clean Code**

I've just finished cleaning up `paxscript.js`, specifically removing redundant bindings in `cargaDatosContrato` success and duplicate validation in `guardaDatosContrato`. Now, I'm verifying the changes, although I can't easily test the UI.

**Reviewing Contract Data Loading**

I realize I was too aggressive with the removal from `cargaDatosContrato`. I need to re-examine the context of its success block. Specifically, I'm concerned about the impact of removing that section related to the `opciones` object within the `multi_replace_file_content` function, lines 257 onward.

## User Request

Sobre siguiente issue planteado en la conversacion anterior , analizalo y determina si ya esta aplicado al codigo fuente.
"¿Por qué no se rasteó el "Tiene Conexión"?
Investigué el archivo includes/negocio/contratos.php en la función guardaContrato(). El mapeo y guardado en la base de datos sí funciona a la perfección: se ejecutó libremente el UPDATE contrato_toma SET tiene_agua=0... y quedó almacenado bajo el control V2.

El defecto arquitectónico (El Issue Oculto): Tu función jamás "escucha" o compara los campos físicos (tiene_agua, tiene_drenaje ni el tipo Comercial/Normal) antes de sobreescribir la tabla. Las únicas dos banderas a las que se les puso un Trigger artificial para dejar registro en cambios fueron estado_agua y estado_drenaje (el flujo del agua, no la existencia del tubo).

Debido a ello, tu cambio real no detonó ninguna leyenda y se disfrazó detrás de la consecuencia lógica (la desconexión del estado). Y si hubieses cambiado el esquema de Normal a Comercial, ¡el sistema no hubiera guardado ningún rastro de quién o por qué le subió la tarifa a esa toma!"

### Thinking

**Addressing the Flaw**

I'm now zeroing in on the "architectural flaw" concerning `guardaContrato()`. It seems crucial changes to physical infrastructure and tariff types are not being tracked. I am evaluating the implications of this oversight in `includes/negocio/contratos.php`, and assessing the possible impact. This requires more investigation into the data integrity and historical record repercussions.

### Thinking

**Reviewing Infrastructure Tracking**

I've confirmed that infrastructure tracking is present within the code, specifically lines 462-483. The implementation includes conditional checks within the PHP code to ensure the tracking works as expected.


**Analyzing Infrastructure Changes**

I'm now digging into how infrastructure changes are logged. The script uses conditional statements (lines 468, 473, and 478) to compare the 'before' and 'after' states of water, drainage, and type of infrastructure. Based on these comparisons, an insertion of new data to the changes table will occur, to reflect what type of infrastructure was changed.


**Verifying Change Recording**

I've examined the change logging, specifically lines 479-482. The script logs tariff changes to the 'cambios' table, which I initially thought was the case. However, the user points out a potential issue: a change in tariff might not be recorded depending on the implementation. I'm now cross-referencing this with the history to see if there are any discrepancies in the recording.


**Investigating Field Updates**

I'm now focused on the main contract fields: `agua`, `drenaje`, and `tipo`. I see there's a problem in lines 528-534. `actualiza_sync` handles the old fields but it seems to be missing the comparison and logging logic. I'm checking if the new changes are being logged if legacy fields are not updated. My hypothesis is that these key fields are not correctly reflecting changes in all cases, potentially requiring an update to track the changes effectively, which could explain the discrepancies in the logs the user reported.


**Clarifying Field Tracking**

I'm now clarifying the field tracking strategy. While the global summary fields (`agua`, `drenaje`, `tipo` in `contrato`) aren't logged, the V2 source of truth (`contrato_toma`) *is* being tracked. I confirm this in lines 462-483. The user's input prompted me to look into the update loop for `contrato_toma`, and I've reviewed lines 448-461. The code does retrieve these key values, and updates accordingly.


**Confirming Tracking Implementation**

Okay, I've re-examined the code block focusing on lines 457 through 482, specifically around the `contrato_toma` updates. I initially thought the tracking might have been implemented after the conversation, however, I confirmed the tracking of individual 'toma' updates **is** present and operational. The crucial point is that the system now correctly compares the pre-update values (from `$tomas_actuales`) with the values after the `UPDATE` statement. Conditional statements within this section then correctly check for and record changes. I am now double checking if there might be a flaw in this particular tracking implementation, and have begun to focus on line 468's conditional.


**Refining Bug Hypothesis**

I'm now refining my understanding of the "hidden issue." The logic within lines 463-483 appears correct at first glance. However, it's possible that data type conversions could introduce errors. The script updates legacy fields in the `UPDATE` operation, and this could introduce changes to other values. I see an interesting interaction on line 449 with the `intval` function. It looks like the "hidden issue" is partially mitigated.


**Uncovering Potential Issue**

I've found a critical logic flaw. Specifically, on line 468, the code checks if `tiene_agua` has changed. If a checkbox is *unchecked* in the form, the corresponding value (`tiene_agua` or `tiene_drenaje`) is *not* sent in the `$_POST` array, so `obtenerValorSeguro` defaults to 0, which correctly indicates removal. However, I now believe the main issue is, this approach is the desired behavior for *new* tomas, but the script applies to existing ones too. This results in the system correctly recording the change as *Inexistente*, which is correct behavior for new tomas, but it means a connection can erroneously change the log to *Inexistente* in the table. I need to rethink this section of code.


**Confirming Tracking Implementation**

I'm now comparing my understanding of lines 487-497 with the user's input. The user mentions triggers for `estado_agua` and `estado_drenaje`, while I see tracking implemented for `tiene_agua` and `tiene_drenaje`. However, after reviewing the code, it seems the system also tracks `estado_agua` and `estado_drenaje` in lines 487-491 to record disconnections, via calls to `_quitaCargoAnual()`, which is a different function. This confirms that these states are also tracked. Given the user mentions both, perhaps the code I see is newer.


**Analyzing Default Values**

I'm now investigating potential default value issues in the code. Line 451, specifically the use of `obtenerValorSeguro($td, 'estado_agua', 1)`, could be problematic. If the radio button for `estado_agua` isn't selected, it defaults to 1. This could lead to a false positive, incorrectly logging a reconnection if the previous state was 0. I will now examine the implementation of `ficha.php` to better understand the contexts in which this is used, focusing on why some radio buttons might be absent.


**Clarifying Value Tracking**

I'm now clarifying how the `estado_agua` and `tiene_agua` flags interact. I was initially concerned about default values, however, I've confirmed that the code handles both scenarios (editable and non-editable) robustly within the `toma` loop. It uses a hidden field to preserve the value even when not editable. My analysis suggests that, if `tiene_agua` is set to `0`, `estado_agua` will also be `0`, and the infrastructure log will show `Existente -> Inexistente`, as intended. I need to consider why the user did not observe their expected behavior, and am now tracking down the code.


**Identifying Reconciliation Opportunities**

I've discovered a critical oversight in the reconnection process. While disconnections (tiene_agua to 0) are correctly logged and trigger associated actions, the reverse (tiene_agua from 0 to 1) does *not* trigger any direct reconnection logging in guardaContrato. It also doesn't check and apply the necessary charges. I believe this explains why the user might have found discrepancies. I must examine how the reconnection logic is handled in cambiaEstadoConexion, and consider potential integration to ensure a complete infrastructure change record.

**Analyzing Missing Data Points**

I've hit a snag. I'm investigating why "Infrastructura Agua Toma 1" is missing, while "Desconexion agua toma 1" (id 4899) exists. Looking at the code associated with the latter, specifically how `$tomas_actuales` is handled, might offer a clue. I'm exploring the logic around how water state is determined and stored to find the discrepancy. This might also point to why the required Infrastructure data isn't showing.


**Investigating Status vs. Connection**

I'm now focusing on the distinction between the connection status and the physical connection itself. My investigation points to a possible gap: if a user changes the connection status, but not the physical connection, the "Infrastructura" data may not be recorded. The code's handling of `$ant_t_agua` and `$t_agua` seems central to this. It looks like changing the physical connection state (like unchecking "Tiene Conexión") might only trigger a "Desconexion" record, potentially masking the underlying infrastructure change. This also raises a concern: If I uncheck a connection, the logical status also has to update in the UI.


**Unraveling Logic Discrepancies**

I've homed in on a critical vulnerability within `ficha.php`. The current implementation of the water connection status relies heavily on the `tiene_agua` flag. It seems that when a user unchecks "Tiene Conexion," the logic correctly updates `tiene_agua` to 0. However, the system might not always force `estado_agua` to 0, which would lead to the very data point I'm missing! The hidden field's behavior in the HTML further complicates things, making sure I examine the logic in `guardaContrato` for any existing `Desconexion` records when a connection is terminated.


**Pinpointing Timing Flaw**

I've hit the core of the issue: the order of operations in `ficha.php`. The database is updated *before* the crucial check for changes in the connection status. Line 457 updates the `contrato_toma` table, then the script checks for connection state changes using the *old* data loaded in `$tomas_actuales`. This explains the missing "Desconexion" record for when I changed water connection states. This explains why the infrastructure data is not being captured. The comparison (`$ant_t_agua != $t_agua`) should work, yet it doesn't.

### Thinking

**Investigating Broken Tracking**

I'm currently focused on why the "Infrastructura" and "Cambio de Tarifa" tracking isn't functioning as expected, despite being implemented in the code. I'm taking a closer look at the `guardaContrato` function, specifically line 430. My objective is to pinpoint the root cause of this malfunction, which currently eludes me.


**Analyzing Tracking Location**

I've been analyzing the code and found that the tracking logic should be executing correctly, given the structure of the `tomas` array and the conditional logic. The `foreach` loop iteration using `$n` appears to align with the array indices. I see the update and insert queries that do the tracking. However, I noticed that the tracking code is inside the `else` block as I previously surmised. It is correct. I am now proceeding.


**Uncovering Key Comparisons**

I've hit a roadblock. I now suspect a critical error within the comparison logic used for `$vars`. Lines 513-526 are suspect. I believe there's a problem, especially when comparing values. I suspect this will cause a problem with the INSERT statement on lines 532, and this will break the tracking. I see a likely root cause.

### Thinking

**Discovering an Anomaly**

I'm puzzled, still no "Infrastructura" in sight, which is very strange considering the code. But wait, I might have found the problem! It looks like how `$td` is retrieved might be the issue. I'm focusing on the retrieval method to debug this strange code.


**Analyzing Form Submission**

I'm now investigating how the form is submitted in `paxscript.js`, specifically the `ajaxSubmit` method and the data structure `tomas[1][tiene_agua]`. It's crucial because the data should be available on the form. Simultaneously, I've confirmed that the database query in `contratos.php` retrieves the relevant data. I'm checking the interaction between these two elements, since it looks like the variable `$tomas_data` may be mismatched with `$num_toma`.


**Uncovering Order of Operations**

I've pinpointed an architectural flaw concerning the order of operations. The crucial realization is that the `UPDATE` query on line 457 modifies data, which is then used on line 464 for a comparison. However, the data used for the comparison, `$tomas_actuales`, was fetched *before* the update on line 430. Thus, I'm now certain the `ant_t_agua` variable holds the old, and not the current, value.


**Investigating Potential Errors**

I'm now zeroing in on a potential misinterpretation of the `$t_agua` variable. It acts as a flag: `0` for unchecked, `1` for checked, and I'm ensuring there are no hidden interactions with global or extracted variables; thankfully, the scope seems tight. Next, I'm recalling why I did not see the records in the database, because record `4899`, for instance, might not have been applied at the user requested time. I'll re-inspect the `contratos.php` file content to confirm the changes and confirm a comment I previously saw.


**Examining Tracking Deficiencies**

I've discovered a critical issue: while changes to `estado_agua` and `estado_drenaje` are properly tracked, the system lacks a complete audit trail for *reconnections* related to `estado_agua`. I'm now examining the logic surrounding those flags, specifically the conditional branches in the `if/else` statement. I'm focusing on the "Connect" case to see why there is no tracking for this action. Furthermore, I am assessing any potential conflicts of database connections.


**Confirming Error Fix**

I'm now quite certain that the code includes the necessary fix for tracking `tipo` changes. My analysis reveals a conditional check that captures modifications to this field, which is then recorded in the database. The radio buttons submit a value for `tipo`, so the change is always recorded. To ensure it is tracked, I am inspecting how the changes were saved, as it appears they should be correctly captured. Perhaps a version mismatch or a silent failure is at play, because the fix is in the code.

### Thinking

**Analyzing the Error**

I realized `mysqli_fetch_array` defaults to `MYSQLI_BOTH`, explaining why `$ta['tiene_agua']` functions as expected. However, the architectural weakness persists, specifically within the history recording process. Examining the `guardaContrato` function is crucial for rectification.


**Investigating the Discrepancy**

I've been digging into why a specific log entry is missing, focusing on a recent change where "tiene\_agua" modifications should trigger an infrastructure record. The missing log suggests that the fix wasn't active or fully functional during the initial logs. I'm scrutinizing the source code again to ensure the trigger conditions are met, and comparing them to the user's previous description of applied changes.


**Pinpointing the Fault**

I think I've found the issue in the tracking code within `guardaContrato`. The problem appears to be using `$n`, which represents the toma number, instead of the human-readable description for the infrastructure change in the `INSERT` statements. This explains why the logs are vague. The fix is to use the correct user-friendly descriptions. Specifically, the queries at lines 471, 476, and 481, are the ones at fault.


**Confirming the Scope**

I've realized the user's "artificial trigger" statement only accounts for two flags, while I've identified five potential trigger points in `contratos.php`. This discrepancy raises the question of whether the trigger code has been properly tested or if some type mismatch is obscuring its effects. I'm focusing on lines 471, 476, 481, 490, and 496 in `contratos.php`. Specifically, I am concerned that the database update occurs *before* the infrastructure tracking, which could be the source of the intermittent logging.


**Examining the Code**

I'm now revisiting the critical code block. My initial focus was comparing the database update order to the infrastructure tracking. However, I realize I might be overthinking it; the old values from `$tomas_actuales` should be correct regardless of the database's current state. Then, I realized a data type mismatch could be a problem, but it's not. I see a different, more logical, flaw in the user's "Issue Oculto" description, so it should have recorded, but did not. I am considering looking at conversation logs to seek a prior discussion of this part of the code. Finally, I will be using grep to search on the user's environment.

### Thinking

**Analyzing the Recordings**

I'm now focusing on why the system hasn't recorded those values. My analysis has led me to these possible explanations: perhaps nobody has updated the respective fields since the code was integrated, the code is malfunctioning, or it was introduced very recently. I have determined no earlier records exist, and I am pursuing these leads.


**Investigating the Data Source**

I've determined I mistakenly assumed the key `tiene_agua` was missing. The issue lies within the database query itself, specifically within the `y->q` function. Suppressed errors are obscuring the query's actual execution. I'm carefully reviewing the SQL statement for potential problems like syntax errors, incorrect column names, or data type mismatches.


**Uncovering an Insertion Error**

I've homed in on a critical insertion issue. The `INSERT` query at line 471 is my current focus. I suspect this query might be the root cause and I'm looking carefully at its construction to pinpoint a syntax or data-related error. I need to ensure all the variables are correctly formatted and that the data types align with the database schema. The issue may be the key to the main problem.


**Pinpointing the Silent Failure**

I believe I've zeroed in on the culprit: a logical flaw within the tracking code. Examining lines 464, 487-497 in conjunction, reveals a potential area where updates may be suppressed due to a conditional logic error. The checkbox issue has also been fully checked, and it is present. The `numcontrato` length is probably not the issue. A quote is probably also not the issue. I am now following leads.


**Detecting the Modification**

I've discovered the `$tomas_actuales` variable at line 430 contains the `tiene_agua` field, confirming its availability. I then revisited the `INSERT` query at line 471, and examined the use of `$n`, an integer representing the toma. My suspicion is that the code in `contratos.php` was recently updated to incorporate the logic I am looking at, however, the new triggers may not be firing or have not been successfully engaged by a user.


**Clarifying the Source**

I'm now certain the user's concern revolves around legacy fields within the `contrato` table. The existing code overwrites `agua`, `drenaje`, and `tipo` silently. I am verifying that the `contrato_toma` fields are tracked, as the user might not perceive this as a comprehensive log. This aligns with the user's assertion that changes to Normal/Comercial would go untracked, since only the legacy `contrato` table is directly modified and not audited.


**Confirming Trigger Activation**

I'm now certain I've found a failure at line 481. I'm reexamining `guardaContrato`, specifically assessing the potential for an empty `$tomas_data` array, but that's unlikely. I am trying to determine if the relevant tracking code has been applied. My conclusion: Tracking is active for `contrato_toma`, but silent for the legacy `contrato` table. The user likely views the contract-level, global log. Also, I'm verifying the `INSERT INTO cambios` at line 471. There is mention of "Desconexion" in the logs, and this is "estado_agua".


**Confirming Implementation Existence**

I've determined that the code *is* in place and tracking for `tiene_agua` and `estado_agua`, contradicting the user's assertion. I'm seeing the triggers at lines 471 and 490, respectively, within `contratos.php`. I'll clarify this discrepancy and verify if the user's focus is on those V1 fields. If I can, I'll confirm that the tracking for `contrato_toma` data exists in V2 as well. This should resolve the discrepancy.


**Verifying Current Code**

I've confirmed that the "Cambio de Tarifa" trigger at line 481 addresses the user's specific concern about Normal to Comercial schema changes. It's definitely active in the current version. I checked my recent history and don't believe I applied this. I'll also verify the `if ($actualiza != "")` block at line 531 in relation to the user's issue.


**Validating the Logic**

I've homed in on a crucial code segment, specifically the update to `contrato_toma` and the subsequent logging. I've confirmed that the old value (`$ant_t_agua`) is retrieved *before* the update, but the comparison happens *after*. This discrepancy, where the values are already different, may not be relevant to the issue. I'm now certain the logic correctly tracks changes to the `contrato_toma` values, by comparing the values.

## Agent Response

### Thinking

**Analyzing Code Vulnerability**

I've been examining `usuarios.php`, specifically the `cargaSnapshot($id)` function (lines 405-432). I'm focusing on the SQL query at line 412, which appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection if `$id` isn't properly sanitized. I'm investigating how this variable is handled.

- Last modified: 2026-04-10T02:20:05Z

### USER Objective:
Stabilizing Agua Financial Saneamiento

The user's objective is to stabilize the Agua web application by refactoring contract status logic and implementing a robust, web-based financial saneamiento system. Key goals include:
1. Implementing defensive coding to enforce logical contract state transitions and prevent "Avalancha Punitiva" and "Deuda Zombi".
2. Developing a centralized, parameter-driven administrative dashboard (`admin/saneamiento/`) for historical data cleanup (2018-2026), specifically targeting "Cargos Fantasma".
3. Ensuring all saneamiento operations include audit trails and rollback capabilities via a new `batch_id` column to maintain fiscal integrity during the migration to the V2 schema.
4. Organizing project assets and infrastructure within a dedicated `feature/saneamiento-v2` branch to ensure consistency with Host C migration requirements while maintaining a clean, modular codebase.

## Conversation bdc4ae35-3174-4334-aa14-a427816e51bc: Migrating Assembly V2 Webapp
- Created: 2026-04-08T17:39:02Z
- Last modified: 2026-04-09T04:20:54Z

### USER Objective:
Finalizing Asamblea V2 Attendance Integration

The user's objective is to finalize the standalone 'Asamblea V2' module by ensuring the attendance registration and reporting workflows are fully functional and compatible with the legacy system. Key goals include:
1. UI/UX Refinement: Improving the admin grid layout and action button styling.
2. Data Integrity: Ensuring multi-contract users are correctly grouped in the attendance list and ticket generation, while maintaining the legacy TXT report format for compatibility with the existing `asistencias.php` import process.
3. System Synchronization: Verifying that the generated attendance TXT files remain compatible with the legacy `core.php` processing logic to prevent integration errors.
4. Architectural Consolidation: Maintaining the `agua_chatledger` repository as the definitive source of truth for all project documentation and configuration, utilizing symlinks to ensure consistency across development environments.

## Conversation aaee12b1-ccf8-44bc-b37a-b2cd531092cf: Stabilizing Host C Application Reports
- Created: 2026-04-08T04:34:54Z
- Last modified: 2026-04-08T06:52:29Z

### USER Objective:
Stabilizing Agua Application Migration

The user's objective is to finalize the stabilization of the Agua web application on the Host C environment by completing a comprehensive audit of legacy code patterns, refactoring deprecated PHP functions to ensure compatibility with PHP 7.4/8.x, and removing obsolete legacy libraries to streamline the codebase. The goal is to ensure full operational integrity with MariaDB 10.4 by verifying that all administrative reports and CRUD operations correctly utilize the V2 split-schema views.

## Conversation 3b5dff64-1c3c-474c-9796-423733a337f5: Tracking Contract Status Changes
- Created: 2026-04-03T04:29:44Z
- Last modified: 2026-04-08T05:18:33Z

### USER Objective:
Tracking Contract Status Changes

The user's objective is to audit the recent status change history for contract #1167, associated with user JOSE GUADALUPE RIOS MALDONADO (userId 1329). The goal is to query the database—specifically checking the `cambios` or relevant audit tables—to determine if the contract's status has been modified recently and, if so, to retrieve the specific details of that transition.

## Conversation 8c334798-0ddd-466f-b9a2-ec9516a28366: Optimizing MariaDB Slow Query Logging
- Created: 2026-04-07T22:04:49Z
- Last modified: 2026-04-08T02:03:21Z

### USER Objective:
Optimizing Contract Data Performance

The user's objective is to resolve performance latency in the `ficha.php` contract view on the Host C environment. The goal is to optimize the database queries—specifically those involving `vw_ligacargos_all` and `cargos`—by refactoring the underlying SQL logic within `includes/negocio/contratos.php` to leverage the previously implemented covering indexes, ensuring faster data retrieval for contract records and associated financial history.

- Created: 2026-04-08T01:08:50Z
- Last modified: 2026-04-08T01:26:02Z

### USER Objective:
Counting Users On Host C

The user's objective is to determine the total number of records in the `users` table on the Host C database environment. This involves connecting to the MariaDB instance (port 7002) on Host C and executing a `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;` query to retrieve the current count.

The user's primary objective is to migrate the "Agua" web application from a legacy Linux/LAMPP environment to a modern Windows 10/XAMPP 7.4.33 stack. Key goals include refactoring the codebase to eliminate hardcoded Linux-specific paths, centralizing configuration management for cross-platform portability, and ensuring compatibility with PHP 7.4 and MariaDB 10.4. Additionally, the user is establishing a robust, synchronized, and externalized record of technical documentation and development history using symbolic links to maintain consistency across all git branches.

### Thinking

**Reassessing File Locations**

It seems my initial grep configuration was flawed; the expected paths were incorrect. I'm now certain the templates reside in the `views/` directory, rather than the misidentified location. I have checked several obvious files for the reports. I must now look deeper.

**Assessing Data Audit Trail**

I've just finished analyzing the web application's data audit capabilities. Currently, there isn't a readily available report or list for the `cambios` table, and consequently, there's no general audit trail or history readily accessible to the operator that displays the table's complete content.


**Identifying `cambios` Table Usage**

I'm now investigating where the `cambios` table is employed within the current UI. The data from this table appears fragmented, surfacing only in very specific instances. For example, the "Histórico de Cargos Cancelados" table in the contract ficha displays filtered records, while the user ficha snapshot shows information relevant to "Declaratoria No Localizado". I'm also confirming that the `admin/auditoria_recargos_suspendidos.php` file, which audits debts, doesn't use the `cambios` table. Despite this, the system is logging several key infrastructure and ownership changes.

**Designing Audit Log Report**

I'm currently focused on the audit log report design. I've pinpointed the `cambios` table as the data source and am sketching out the key fields to include. The plan is to create a new report that offers a clear and concise view of activity. I'll need to figure out which filters are most useful.

**Adding Audit History Button**

I've located the "Ver Credencial" button at line 45 and am ready to add the "Ver Historial de Auditoría" button directly below it. I'm initiating the development of `reportes/historial_auditoria.php` and drawing design inspiration from `admin/auditoria_recargos_` to achieve a clean and modern aesthetic.

**Refining Data Classification**

I realize now that marking codebase files as artifacts was incorrect. My recent focus is now correcting the `IsArtifact` setting. I'm rewriting the logic to ensure that only files within the dedicated `<appDataDir>/brain/<conversation-id>/` directory are classified as artifacts, not the code itself.

**Adjusting the Layout**

I'm in the process of adapting the button's appearance and placement. The goal is to change the button text to "**Movimientos**" and place it below the "Cargar información del usuario" button. I'm currently assessing `ficha.php` for positioning considerations.


**Refining the Button Placement**

I'm now focusing on `ficha.php` and I am examining line 44 and after, to get an understanding of the structure to add my button. The plan is still to put the new button below the "Cargar información del usuario" button. I am trying to understand the current flexbox layout to make my button fit seamlessly.


**Clarifying Button Placement**

I've clarified the button placement. My intention is to put the "Movimientos" button within the same vertical `div` as "Cargar información del usuario", which should place it directly below. I'm focusing on incorporating the new button within the `ficha.php` file, specifically the section concerning the existing buttons. I aim to create a cohesive placement.


**Revising Button Styles**

I've decided to refine the button's style to match other buttons within the same `div`. I'm removing the extra inline styles from the "Ver Historial" button, aiming for a consistent `liga opcion` class. I also re-evaluated the layout and the request for the button placement "a la derecha", and decided to check the flexbox layout in `ficha.php` on line 34, to determine the correct placement. I have now decided the button needs to be below the "Ver Credencial" button, and thus needs its own vertical `div`.

I'm currently focused on the `reportes/historial_auditoria.php` file, and now want to make the date output long-form, like "10 de Abril de 2026". I'll be exploring the file structure to pinpoint the date formatting section and identify where this change needs to occur.

**Adjusting Date Formatting**

I've just updated the date format within the report. Now, I'm verifying if the user has a preference for that same format to be integrated into the report footer as well. It's a quick adjustment, as the footer already features a similar structure, and I am reviewing it now.

"El problema arquitectónico es el siguiente: Cuando al inicio del año (o al reactivar el contrato) se te cargó la anualidad del drenaje, el sistema insertó la deuda de $220.00 en la tabla ligacargos. Sin embargo, al editar hoy la estructura del contrato y dictaminar que de ahora en adelante es de "Tipo: Comercial", el código de la función guardaContrato() solo salva esa bandera en contrato_toma, pero jamás ordena recalcular en retrospectiva los recibos pendientes que ya se emitieron a precio Normal."

### Thinking

**Addressing the Architecture Gap**

I'm focusing on an architectural gap, specifically how changing a contract's type fails to recalculate pending charges. It appears the system doesn't propagate the type change effectively, leaving outstanding calculations stranded. I'm digging into how the system handles contract type transitions and the lifecycle of emitted charges. I need to identify where the recalculation logic should be triggered, and how to avoid the data inconsistency.

I've pinpointed a key interaction: `guardaContrato` invokes `_sincronizaDeudaPendienteContrato` at line 536. Now, I am digging into `_sincronizaDeudaPendienteContrato`, from lines 555 onward, to understand its role in debt synchronization. I'm focusing on the input parameters to understand how the contract is passed in.

**Verifying Bug Fix**

I've confirmed the bug is fixed. Analysis of `guardaContrato` and `_sincronizaDeudaPendienteContrato` reveals the system now correctly handles contract structure changes. I checked that `guardaContrato` properly persists and updates contract details, ensuring no data loss during modifications.


**Analyzing Recalculation Process**

I'm now focusing on how the automated debt calibration, invoked by `guardaContrato`, works. Specifically, I'm examining how `_sincronizaDeudaPendienteContrato` recalculates outstanding charges when operators modify the contract type, water/drainage status, or connection state. The debt recalibration process considers new tariffs, the number of active intakes, and linear meters, triggering automatic updates if there are differences in charge amounts. The current analysis indicates good coverage.

### Thinking

**Analyzing Cancellation Logic**

I've examined the `sp_cancelar_cargo` stored procedure, specifically lines 78-105. My analysis highlights that the procedure sets the cargo's `estado` to -1. The issue is it doesn't verify payment status before attempting the update, operating only when `estado = 0`. Consequently, an already paid cargo, where `estado = 1`, remains uncancelled.


**Clarifying Business Logic**

I've clarified the business logic related to service disconnection and pending debts. If a cashier disconnects a service while a current year's annuity is pending (estado = 0), the system automatically cancels it. This "all or nothing" approach means the cashier implicitly decides whether to cancel the debt when disconnecting. I will explain this operational behavior to the user. I'll need to check if past debts are being handled in a similar way.

## User Request

Investiga si la funcionalidad de Cargos (pantallas php, sp, etc) en esta nueva version si van  a poder permitir cubrir esto:
"El sistema NO restaura automáticamente el cargo cancelado. El cajero tendría que ir a la sección de "Cargos" y aplicarlo manualmente de nuevo, o esperar a que un proceso de mantenimiento global lo detecte."

### Thinking

**Investigating Charge Restoration**

I'm currently looking into how service re-connections in `guardaContrato` affect cancelled charges. My focus is understanding if the existing "Cargos" UI/SP supports an automatic restoration of a cancelled charge when a service is reactivated. This involves tracing the service re-connection process and how charges are handled in that flow.

## Agent Response

### Thinking

**Discovering Code Snippet**

I've just stumbled upon a potentially significant PHP function within `includes/negocio/cargos.php`. Specifically, `regresarCargoCancelado($contrato, $leyenda, $repetido)` (lines 668-678). I think this might be crucial.


**Analyzing Restoration Logic**

I've examined the `regresarCargoCancelado` function. It updates the `ligacargos` and `ligacargos_historico` tables, effectively "restoring" a cancelled charge. The `aplicacargos` function handles the UI application of charges, and includes logic for `normal` and `comercial` scenarios. I believe that the existing infrastructure in the "Cargos" module enables the restoration functionality.

### Thinking

**Implementing UI Logic**

I'm working on the user interface logic now, specifically addressing the "Tiene conexión de Agua" switch. My aim is to ensure that when it's toggled off, the "Estado de Agua" automatically updates to "Desconectado". I'm thinking about integrating this functionality directly within either `paxscript.js` or the template itself. I am leaning toward `paxscript.js` as the more appropriate method.

### Thinking

**Analyzing Form Interactions**

I've been analyzing the form's logic, specifically focusing on how certain checkboxes affect radio button selections. For example, disabling the "Agua" connection checkbox triggers the "Desconectada" radio button automatically. I'm building on this approach to handle other related interactions.

**Implementing UI Logic**

I'm focusing on the UI logic implementation within `views/contratos/ficha.php`. The plan is to extend the existing `<script>` section (lines 172-238) or directly modify the checkbox tags to trigger a JavaScript function, ensuring a well-integrated solution.


**Refining UI Interaction**

I've decided to leverage jQuery for handling checkbox changes, opting for `$(document).ready` or direct `onchange` attributes for simpler event management, and have added a function to handle the interaction logic when a checkbox is unchecked. I need to ensure the correct radio button (disconnected) is selected. I am adding the listeners in `ficha.php`. Now, I'm shifting to other cases as suggested, analyzing interactions for `Tipo` changes.

### Thinking

**Analyzing "Other Cases"**

I've just started to analyze some other important scenarios. For the first case, when the operator selects "Comercial," I think the system should ideally switch to "Conectada/Conectado" states if off, or suggest this action. I am still working on the finer details, but the general concept is sound.


**Reviewing Server-Side Validation**

I've confirmed that the server-side logic in `guardaContrato` correctly handles the reduction of "tomas," specifically deleting the associated data when the operator reduces the number of tomas. I've examined the code and verified the bounds checking and deletion process. I'm satisfied that this scenario is handled.


**Examining Connection Status Protection**

I've been examining the code and have found that the connection status is protected from changes if the contract isn't active, so that aspect is confirmed. Also, on the synchronous domicilio validation, I'm observing the blur event on the domicilio input to check for a maximum of 2 tomas for an owner.

## User Request

Acabo de recordar que la idea de tener el checkbox tiene conexión de agua en  encendido significa que el usuario contrató y tiene la conexión física y el off es que no la tiene, y el radio de estados: conectada y desconectada  siginfican, el primero que el usuario tiene el servicio activo y el segundo que el comite le corto el servicio.
Entonces la duda es, esto implica un rediseño o con los campos que se tiene se puede hacer el mapeo; y si la UI con los controles mencionados son los correctos o pueden ser remplazados por otros que le den mas sentido a los significados  de lo que acabo de describir.

### Thinking

**Clarifying Semantics Now**

I've just refined the semantics, solidifying the meanings of key terms. "Checkbox (Tiene conexión)" now definitively means physical infrastructure presence: ON indicates a pipe, OFF indicates its absence. "Radios (Estado)" describes service activity: "Conectada" signifies an active, flowing service.

**Proposing a Redesign**

I'm now focusing on a complete overhaul of the current labeling system, and also its function. I'm starting by suggesting a new label to replace "Tiene conexión de Agua," namely, "Instalación: [✓] Cuenta con toma física." I also started thinking about other elements to change.

**Clarifying Infrastructure Absence**

I've determined that with the "Physical Installation" checkbox unchecked, the user lacks the necessary physical infrastructure. Consequently, the concepts of "Connecting" or "Cutting" service are irrelevant. I need to block the radio buttons and display a specific legend: *"Sin infraestructura instalada"*. This clarifies the situation.

**Re-analyzing the Change**

I'm now re-evaluating the auto-toggle concept in light of the undo request. The focus is now on determining if the initial change is still applicable, or if a different solution is needed to address the cashier's needs. I'm exploring alternative implementations, keeping in mind the need for a seamless user experience.


**Refining the UI Behavior**

I've moved on from the initial auto-toggle. The "Anti-Confusion" Fix is the new direction. I'm focusing on semantic clarification and dynamic UI elements. New labels will clearly distinguish between infrastructure and admin status. Now I'm considering a conditional UI: when installation is off, the radio buttons are hidden and replaced with a grayed-out label to reduce user confusion, and the hidden input is set to zero.

### Thinking

**Implementing Semantic Refactor**

I'm currently focused on the semantic refactor and the dynamic UI elements. I'm adding descriptive labels for clarity and introducing IDs to radio container wrappers for selective display/hide functionality. A JavaScript function is also being developed to manage visibility based on checkbox states.

**Analyzing Data Source Migration**

I'm now investigating the population of `contrato_toma` columns (`tiene_agua`, `tiene_drenaje`, `estado_agua`, `estado_drenaje`) from the legacy `contrato` table. The usual columns were 'agua' and 'drenaje' in legacy systems, so I need to find the specific SQL migration scripts.

**Analyzing Contract Associations**

I've realized I'm dealing with a one-to-many relationship between `numcontrato` and `contrato_toma`, meaning a single contract might have several "toma" records. I was just checking contract number 1235 and found it has two associated entries. These entries will require careful processing.

**Analyzing Data Migration**

I've confirmed a critical data migration issue. The current data doesn't distinguish between "no pipe" and "pipe cut." Both scenarios are uniformly represented as "No connection (0/0)." This impacts the fidelity of pipe infrastructure tracking significantly, and it necessitates further investigation to determine if the distinction will be implemented, or if a downstream process must be used to derive this distinction.


**Investigating Data Sync**

I'm now focusing on the implications of syncing data from Host A, as this seems to be the current source of truth for `contrato_toma`. The user wants to track a distinction that the legacy system and Host A don't have, but Host A's data overwrites the target with every sync. It looks like implementing the UI change *before* updating Host A's data will cause the distinction to be lost with every sync. My next step is to figure out if Host A's `contrato_toma` is being maintained correctly.

# Regla 03: Procedimiento de Sincronización de Datos (B -> A)

Reglas para refrescar los datos operativos en el ambiente de desarrollo (Host A) desde el espejo de producción (Host B).

---

## 🗑️ Borrado Selectivo (Mandatario)
Al actualizar la BD en el Host A, se debe priorizar la limpieza de **"datos de negocio"** para evitar duplicidades o inconsistencias:
- **Borrar**: Pagos, cargos, movimientos, bitácoras operativas, adeudos y folios.
- **NUNCA Borrar**: Registros de tipo **Configuración**, **Diseño** o **Catálogos**. Esto incluye:
    - Calles (nombres de calles).
    - Tarifas base.
    - Configuraciones del sistema en General (`config_gral` u otras).
    - Mejoras en descripciones de catálogos realizadas en A.

---

## 📐 Adaptación Estructural (Estructura A)
- **Regla**: Los registros transportados de B deben **"mapearse"** a la estructura actual de A.
- **Mandato**: Si A tiene campos nuevos (ej. `repetido`, `id_colonia`, `normalizado`) o tipos de datos actualizados, el proceso de inserción desde B debe manejar estos cambios para asegurar que el sistema en A siga siendo funcional y consistente.

---

## 🔗 Integridad Referencial
Cualquier movimiento parcial de datos debe asegurar que las claves foráneas (`idusuario`, `idsuadmin`, `numcontrato`) sigan apuntando a registros válidos existentes en A, evitando **"registros huérfanos"**.

## 🗂️ Scripts de Sincronización (Implementación Real)

Los scripts que implementan este protocolo ya existen y fueron utilizados exitosamente. Están en:

```
docs-dev/migration-stack2/win10_aguav2/syncawa_hostb_to_hosta/
```

| Script | Rol |
| :--- | :--- |
| `sync_config.sh` | **Config central** — único archivo a editar entre syncs (credenciales, listas de tablas, conteos esperados) |
| `run_sync.sh` | **Orquestador** — ejecuta el pipeline completo. Modos: `--pre-flight`, `--solo-validar`, `--solo-backup` |
| `00_pre_flight.sh` | Compara schemas A vs B, detecta drift de tablas y columnas sin modificar datos |
| `01_backup_host_a.sh` | Backup comprimido de Host A antes de cualquier modificación |
| `02_dump_host_b.sh` | Extrae las tablas de negocio de Host B a archivos `.sql` en `work/` |
| `03_sync_host_a.sql` | Vacía tablas de negocio en A e importa desde `work/`; aplica defaults de columnas nuevas |
| `04_recalc_contrato_toma.sql` | Recalcula la tabla `contrato_toma` (tabla solo-A, no existe en B) |
| `05_validate.sql` | Valida conteos y consistencia referencial post-sync |

### Clasificación de Tablas (en `sync_config.sh`)
- **`TABLES_BUSINESS`**: Se reemplazan desde B — `usuario`, `contrato`, `ligacargos`, `notas`, `cambios`, `egresos`, `asamblea`, `cargos`
- **`TABLES_A_ONLY`**: Se preservan en A — `contrato_toma`, `config_sistema`
- **`TABLES_CATALOG`**: Se preservan en A — `categorias`, `firmantes`, `contrasenas`, `users`
- **`TABLES_IGNORE_IN_B`**: Existen en B pero eliminadas en A — `asistentes`, `recargos`, `ligacategorias`

### Columnas nuevas en A (no existen en B)
Al importar desde B, el post-procesamiento recalcula automáticamente:
- `contrato.exento_recargo_primer_anio` → `1` si `YEAR(fecha) = año actual`
- `cargos.monto_comercial` → `monto * 2` para categorías 2/3 automáticas
- `ligacargos.idpago_vinc` → `''` donde sea NULL

### Comando de Uso
```bash
cd docs-dev/migration-stack2/win10_aguav2/syncawa_hostb_to_hosta/
./run_sync.sh               # Sync completo
./run_sync.sh --pre-flight  # Solo comparar schemas (seguro, sin modificar)
./run_sync.sh --solo-backup # Solo backup de A
```

---
**Nota para Gemini**: Al recibir la instrucción de "refrescar datos" o "importar producción", este es el protocolo de seguridad obligatorio. Los scripts ya existen — referenciarlos antes de proponer pasos manuales.

### Thinking

**Analyzing Recalculation Dynamics**

I've hit a critical point: `contrato_toma` is an A-ONLY table, and Line 43 of `04_recalc_contrato_toma.sql` recalcs it. This strongly suggests that any manual edits to `contrato_toma` will be overwritten during syncs. This is a very important fact to note!

### Thinking

**Observing Data Deletion**

I've been analyzing `04_recalc_contrato_toma.sql`. Line 22, the `DELETE FROM contrato_toma;` command, is particularly concerning. It completely wipes out the `contrato_toma` table every sync run, indicating a potential for data loss and necessitating careful consideration of our strategy.


**Analyzing Data Integrity**

I've realized the `contrato_toma` table isn't just re-inserting from `contrato`, it also causes data inconsistencies with status. The `contrato.agua` column is used as the 'Count of Active Intakes', which creates a data sync challenge. For instance, if a service is cut and ONLY the cut information is in `contrato_toma`, the sync will revert status if `contrato.agua` is still active. The options are to stop overwriting or modify the script to read existing data. But there is a further wrinkle: Host B's direct updates.


**Investigating Committee Actions**

I'm now focusing on how Host B tracks water cuts, since they update the data directly. It seems Host B's legacy system uses `agua=0` for both "No pipe" and "Cut pipe," which creates a sync conflict. It's critical to determine where the committee records cuts. If they use the new Host C webapp, Host C must safeguard its `contrato_toma` data to differentiate between a physical "No pipe" and a committee-ordered "Cut". I'm thinking of mapping historic records to `agua=1` or `agua=0` for clarity.


**Addressing Data Synchronization**

I'm now zeroing in on the data sync strategy, seeing as Host C's UI will allow operators to record "Corte" status. The current `04_recalc_contrato_toma.sql` script, however, is a problem, because it deletes and regenerates `contrato_toma`, and this will mean Host C's data gets wiped. I'm now pushing for an "additive" or "preservative" sync, perhaps with `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`. There's also the Host B legacy issue to keep in mind, and that the recaudación system may lose "Corte" distinctions. I will be looking to resolve these sync conflicts.

### Thinking

**Confirming My Suspicions**

My fear is now confirmed: Host C isn't a persistent source of truth for business data. The database `awa` on Host C undergoes frequent "DROP" operations, suggesting its data is transient, an environment of observation or improvement, likely refreshed from a production source like Host B.


**Analyzing Data Granularity**

I've realized that if Host C's database is dropped and recreated, any detailed statuses saved via the WebApp are lost, becoming ephemeral. This limits our ability to store more granular data in C compared to B, unless we find a method to preserve it or map it from B's existing data. I'm now investigating how Host B might represent "Cut" status; perhaps it uses `agua=0` or `agua=2`.


**Investigating Host B Source**

I'm now diving deeper into Host B, focusing on how "Cut" status is represented, specifically looking at the `cambios` and `notas` tables. Parsing notes seems complex, but I'm checking the feasibility of it. I'm considering user intent: are they preparing for a live switch to Host C and refactoring labels? UX consistency in labels like "Desconectada" and "Tiene conexión" might be a driving factor. I'm warning that without modifications in B, records will remain indistinct as `1/1` (Connected) or `0/0` (No pipe). Finally, the `04_recalc_contrato_toma.sql` script's Case 4, where `agua=0`, `drenaje=0` implies contracts without active services is a key indicator.


**Clarifying Source Data Integrity**

I'm now zeroing in on the implications of Host C's database being ephemeral. Since Host C is refreshed, I'm questioning the reliability of the WebApp's "Guardar Cambios" function. Any changes saved there are essentially lost unless mirrored back to Host B. We shouldn't rely on Host C for persistent business logic updates unless it is Production. I'm focusing on the UI now; I will label values in Host C more sincerely to match Host B's logic to enhance user clarity and reduce confusion about the meanings of flags, for example, naming Active vs Inactive, or, Active service vs No Active Service.

---

## 🔍 Bitácora de Descubrimiento (Pendientes de Validar)
Espacio para anotar comportamientos detectados en el código legado o procedimientos manuales que deben formalizarse como reglas:
1.  **[D001]**: Investigar el trigger exacto de `calcula_recargos.php` para definir la fecha de corte mensual.
2.  **[D002]**: Validar la lógica de "Metros Lineales" y su impacto en la deuda histórica.
3.  **[D003]**: Determinar si existen descuentos automáticos por "Pronto Pago" no documentados.

---
**Nota para todos los agentes IA (Claude Code y Antigravity/Gemini)**: Al explorar el código, si descubres una nueva restricción o lógica condicional, agrégala aquí con un ID incremental y su módulo correspondiente.

# Regla 01: Infraestructura y Hosts (A, B, C)

Esta regla define los entornos operativos de **Agua** y el acceso mandatorio por Host.

## 🏢 Definición de Hosts

| Host | OS | Propósito | Rama Git | MCP Access | Mandatorio |
|:---:|---|---|---|---|:---:|
| **A** | Ubuntu 22 / XAMPP Linux | Desarrollo / Próximo Producción | `main` | `bdawahost-a` | **Estructura** |
| **B** | Windows 7 / MySQL legado | Espejo Producción — Datos Frescos | N/A | `bdawahost-b` | **Datos** |
| **C** | Windows 10 / XAMPP 7.4.33 Portable | V2 activo — BD optimizada + webapp adaptada | `feature/upgrade-v2-win-xampp` | `bdawahost-c` | N/A |

### Stack Host C (detalle)
| Componente | Versión |
| :--- | :--- |
| Paquete | `xampp-portable-windows-x64-7.4.33-0` |
| Apache | 2.4.54 |
| MariaDB | 10.4.27 |
| PHP | 7.4.33 |
| phpMyAdmin | 5.2.0 |
| Directorio XAMPP | `F:\xampp` |
| Webapp | `F:\xampp\htdocs\agua` |

## 📐 Jerarquía y Mandatos:
1.  **Host A Especial**: Es la **Guía Estructural Oficial**. Cualquier discrepancia entre A y B se resuelve a favor de A (tablas nuevas, índices, campos eliminados).
2.  **Host B de Datos**: Únicamente se utiliza como fuente de "Datos Frescos de Negocio" para alimentar A. Solo lectura — prohibido cambios estructurales.
3.  **Host C de Preview**: Entorno para la optimización de `ligacargos` (split histórico) y preview de todos los cambios antes de producción. Todo cambio con scripts versionados + rollback.

---
**Acceso Técnico**:
- MCP `bdawahost-a` para consultas y ejecuciones en el ambiente de desarrollo.
- MCP `bdawahost-b` exclusivamente para extracción de datos operativos (pagos, cargos).
- MCP `bdawahost-c` para deploy y validación de scripts en Host C (Windows 10).

### 📂 Rutas de Logs Host C
| Archivo | Ruta | Propósito |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Slow Query Log | `F:/aguav2/logs/mysql-slow.log` | Queries > 1s + queries sin índice + SPs |
| Error Log | `F:/aguav2/logs/mysql_error.log` | Errores y warnings de MariaDB |
| General Log | `F:/aguav2/logs/mysql-general.log` | Todas las queries (OFF por defecto) |
| PHP Error Log | `F:/aguav2/logs/php_error.log` | Errores PHP de la webapp |
| PID File | `F:/aguav2/logs/mysql.pid` | PID del proceso MariaDB |

- **Config MariaDB**: [optimizacion/my.ini](file:///opt/lampp/htdocs/agua/docs-dev/migration-aguav2/host-c-setup/optimizacion/my.ini)
- **Config PHP**: [optimizacion/php.ini](file:///opt/lampp/htdocs/agua/docs-dev/migration-aguav2/host-c-setup/optimizacion/php.ini)
- **Config Apache**: [optimizacion/httpd.conf](file:///opt/lampp/htdocs/agua/docs-dev/migration-aguav2/host-c-setup/optimizacion/httpd.conf)

---

## 🔌 Herramienta Preferida por Tipo de Operación (Agentes IA)

| Operación | Herramienta | Razón |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Diagnóstico, validación, queries ad-hoc, comparación de datos | **MCP** (`bdawahost-c`) | Resultados en contexto, paralelo, sin parseo de terminal |
| Scripts `.sql` masivos, dumps, carga de migraciones grandes | **CLI MySQL** | Más eficiente para operaciones de volumen |

**Regla**: Usar MCP para todo trabajo de diagnóstico e inspección en Host C. Recurrir a CLI MySQL solo para scripts masivos o cuando el MCP no esté disponible.

# Regla 06: Accesos, Rutas y Herramientas (A/B/C)

Esta regla consolida los accesos a los tres ambientes de **Agua** y define cuándo usar MCP vs CLI MySQL.

---

## Host A — Linux XAMPP (Desarrollo / Próximo Producción)

| Recurso | Ruta / Credencial |
|---------|-------------------|
| **XAMPP Home** | `/opt/lampp` |
| **PHP Bin** | `/opt/lampp/bin/php` |
| **MySQL Bin** | `/opt/lampp/bin/mysql` |
| **Source Code** | `/opt/lampp/htdocs/agua` |
| **Web URL** | `http://localhost/agua/login/index2.php` |
| **Web User / Pass** | `nancy` / `260180` |
| **MySQL** | `127.0.0.1:3306` · user `root` · pass `comite_2026` · db `awa` |
| **MCP** | `bdawahost-a` |

## Host B — Windows 7 MySQL legado (Solo lectura — datos frescos)

| Recurso | Valor |
|---------|-------|
| **MySQL** | `192.168.1.120:3306` · user `root` · pass `sdrastbuy` · db `awa` |
| **MCP** | `bdawahost-b` |

## Host C — Windows 10 XAMPP Portable 7.4.33 (V2 MariaDB)

| Recurso | Valor |
|---------|-------|
| **Web URL** | `http://192.168.1.128:7001/agua` |
| **Apache** | puerto `7001` |
| **MariaDB** | `192.168.1.128:7002` · user `root` · pass `comite_2026` · db `awa` |
| **MCP** | `bdawahost-c` |
| **XAMPP dir** | `F:\xampp` · Webapp: `F:\xampp\htdocs\agua` |

> **Puerto no estándar (7002):** El MCP de Host C requiere el patch de `entrypoint-patch.sh`
> aplicado al contenedor Docker `context7-mcp-mysql`. Sin el patch, `@f4ww4z/mcp-mysql-server`
> ignora el puerto de la URL y falla con ETIMEDOUT.
> Ver: `docs-dev/ga-cl-ia/issue-mcp-mysql-port-no-estandar.md`

---

## Arquitectura MCP — Docker context7-mcp-mysql

Los tres MCPs comparten **un solo contenedor Docker** con patches aplicados al arrancar:

```bash
# Estructura de cada MCP en .mcp.json
docker exec -i context7-mcp-mysql npx -y @f4ww4z/mcp-mysql-server mysql://user:pass@host:PORT/db
```

- Contenedor: `context7-mcp-mysql` (imagen `mcp/context7:latest`)
- Compose: `docs-dev/ga-cl-ia/docker-compose.yml`
- Patch: `docs-dev/ga-cl-ia/entrypoint-patch.sh` (soporte puerto no estándar — idempotente)
- Config activa: `.mcp.json` (symlink → `.chatledger/.mcp.json`)

> **NUNCA eliminar `.mcp.json`** ni reemplazar `docker exec` por `npx` directo.
> `mcp_config.json` en `.agents/` es la fuente de verdad de referencia — `.mcp.json` debe ser idéntico.

---

## Regla: MCP vs CLI MySQL

| Operación | Herramienta | Razón |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Diagnóstico, validación, queries ad-hoc, comparación entre hosts | **MCP** | Resultados en contexto, ejecutable en paralelo, sin parseo de terminal |
| Scripts con `DELIMITER`, stored procedures, triggers | **CLI MySQL** | MCP no soporta `DELIMITER` |
| Dumps, cargas masivas, migraciones de volumen | **CLI MySQL** | Más eficiente para operaciones de volumen |
| MCP no disponible o contenedor Docker caído | **CLI MySQL** | Fallback |

**Regla general**: Usar MCP para todo trabajo de diagnóstico e inspección. Recurrir a CLI solo cuando la operación lo requiera explícitamente.

CLI Host A: `/opt/lampp/bin/mysql -u root -pcomite_2026 awa`
CLI Host C (desde Host A): `/opt/lampp/bin/mysql -h 192.168.1.128 -P 7002 -u root -pcomite_2026 awa`

---
**Nota**: Cualquier script de automatización que requiera ejecución directa de PHP o MySQL debe referenciar los binarios en `/opt/lampp/bin/` para compatibilidad con el stack legado.

# Regla 05: Despliegue y Automatización (Host C)

Reglas para la migración e implementación de mejoras en el ambiente **Host C** (MariaDB 10.4.27 / XAMPP 7.4.33).

---

## Estado Actual (2026-04-07) — Host C UP & RUNNING ✓ — Procesos validados

La migración inicial está **completada y ambos pipelines probados en ejecución real**. Host C tiene:
- BD `awa` con schema v2 completo (17 tablas InnoDB, utf8mb4, FKs, SPs, 3 vistas)
- `ligacargos` split: activa ≥2026 (~2,607 filas) + `ligacargos_historico` ≤2025 (~191,906 filas)
- Webapp `feature/upgrade-v2-win-xampp` adaptada al schema v2
- Scripts de setup versionados: `docs-dev/migration-stack2/win10_aguav2/host-c-setup/` (01–08)
- Script rollback completo: `host-c-setup/08_rollback.sql`
- `tusuario` eliminada de BD y de todos los scripts (tabla fantasma — no usada por PHP)

### Pipelines probados (2026-04-07)
- **Proceso 1 (A→C)**: ejecutado y validado — 7/7 checks OK, 25 seg
- **Proceso 2 (setup desde cero + carga)**: simulado completo — scripts 01–05 + sync + split + validaciones 7/7 OK

---

## Propósito del Host C

Ambiente de **V2 activo** — schema optimizado (MariaDB), split histórico de ligacargos, FKs/SPs/vistas nuevas. Cuando Host C sea declarado producción, reemplaza a Host B.

---

## Estrategia de Refresh de Datos (B → A → C)

El refresh de datos de producción hacia Host C **siempre** sigue esta ruta de dos pasos:

```
Host B (prod v1) → Host A (dev v1+) → Host C (v2 MariaDB)
```

**Por qué no B→C directo**: el schema de B (v1) es incompatible con C (v2). Host A actúa como capa de transformación.

### Paso 1 — Sync B → A (script existente)
```bash
cd docs-dev/migration-stack2/win10_aguav2/syncawa_hostb_to_hosta/
./run_sync.sh
```

### Paso 2 — Sync A → C (pipeline)
```bash
cd docs-dev/migration-stack2/win10_aguav2/sync_hosta_to_hostc/
./run_sync.sh
```

El pipeline A→C aplica automáticamente:
- `cambios`: importa con columnas explícitas (C tiene `id` AUTO_INCREMENT col 1)
- `ligacargos.idpago_vinc`: convierte `''` → `NULL` (C usa `int NULL`)
- `ligacargos.fcobro/fpago`: trunca datetime → date
- `egresos.id_categoria`: inserta `NULL` (columna no existe en A)
- Re-ejecuta `06_split_ligacargos.sql` (idempotente vía TRUNCATE)

---

## Configuración Portable (XAMPP 7.4.33)

- **Modo**: XAMPP portable en `F:\xampp` — sin servicios Windows.
- **Directorio webapp**: `F:\xampp\htdocs\agua`
- **Rama git**: `feature/upgrade-v2-win-xampp`

---

## Split `ligacargos` — Implementado

| Tabla | Criterio | Filas aprox |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `ligacargos` (activa) | `anio >= 2026` | ~2,607 |
| `ligacargos_historico` | `anio <= 2025` | ~191,906 |

Las vistas `vw_ligacargos_all` y `vw_ligacargos_pendientes` unifican ambas tablas. Los PHPs no consultan `ligacargos_historico` directamente.

> **CRÍTICO para nuevos PHPs**: Todo SELECT sobre `ligacargos` debe usar `vw_ligacargos_all` (todos) o `vw_ligacargos_pendientes` (estado=0). Los UPDATE masivos de cargos pendientes deben ejecutarse en **ambas** tablas: `ligacargos` y `ligacargos_historico`. Ver regla completa en [skill-database-evolution/SKILL.md](./../skills/skill-database-evolution/SKILL.md#3-regla-crítica--consultas-php-sobre-ligacargos-en-host-c).
>
> Bugs corregidos el 2026-04-07 (commit `bd1cb2f`): `listadeudores.php`, `carteravencida.php`, `concentradocortecajaresumen.php`, `cargos.php`, `genera_csv.php`.

---

## Diferencias de Schema A (v1+) vs C (v2)

| Tabla | Columna | Host A | Host C |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| `cambios` | `id` | no existe | `int AUTO_INCREMENT` col 1 |
| `ligacargos` | PK | composite `(numcontrato,leyenda,repetido)` | `id AUTO_INCREMENT` |
| `ligacargos` | `idpago_vinc` | `varchar('')` | `int NULL` |
| `ligacargos` | `fcobro`/`fpago` | `datetime` | `date` |
| `ligacargos` | `monto`/`recargo` | `float`/`int` | `decimal(10,2)` |
| `egresos` | `id_categoria` | no existe | `int NULL` (FK→categorias_egresos, ON DELETE SET NULL) |
| `contrato_toma` | tabla | calculada post-sync B→A | nativa con FKs |
| `folios_recibo` | tabla | no existe | nueva — AUTO_INCREMENT para folios |
| `tusuario` | tabla | existe (sin uso) | **eliminada** — ningún PHP la consulta |

---

## Rollback

Cualquier cambio estructural en Host C requiere:
1. Script versionado en `host-c-setup/`
2. Actualización de `08_rollback.sql`
3. Actualizar la tabla de diferencias de schema arriba

**Para revertir toda la migración**:
```bash
mysql -u root -pcomite_2026 -h 192.168.1.128 awa < host-c-setup/08_rollback.sql
```

---
**Nota para Gemini**: Al recibir instrucción de "refrescar Host C" o "sync producción→C", el flujo es SIEMPRE B→A→C (dos scripts separados). Nunca B→C directo.

### Thinking

**Locating Key Concepts**

I'm currently trying to pinpoint the "two cases" mentioned. I've been searching through the `.md` files within `.agents/rules` but haven't found them yet. I'm now expanding my search to consider whether they might be embedded within a specific SKILL, WORKFLOW, or perhaps even in a file named `contrato_toma` logic. The search continues.
