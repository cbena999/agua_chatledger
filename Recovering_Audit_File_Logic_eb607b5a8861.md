### USER Objective:
Stabilizing Agua Data Migration

The user's objective is to finalize the full-stack data migration to the V2 MariaDB environment by validating critical financial reports, ensuring procedural integrity across split-schema tables (Active vs. Historical), and confirming that all analytical queries correctly utilize the consolidated `vw_ligacargos_all` view to maintain fiscal accuracy.

## Conversation 641d61c3-6a67-4219-9eb6-f0ca8f22ce82: Validating Automated Debt Sanitation
- Created: 2026-04-11T17:24:33Z
- Last modified: 2026-04-12T00:50:57Z

### USER Objective:
Stabilizing Agua Administrative Infrastructure

The user's objective is to finalize the structural stabilization of the Agua web application following a major directory reorganization. Key goals include:
1. Ensuring full navigation consistency and asset loading (CSS/JS) across all relocated administrative modules by correcting relative paths.
2. Implementing a comprehensive set of compatibility redirects in the `admin/` root directory to prevent 404 errors for legacy bookmarks and system links.
3. Standardizing the UI by adding missing "Return to Menu" navigation links to all administrative reports and control panels.
4. Validating that all financial sanitation and reporting tools remain fully functional and secure within their new subdirectories (`saneamiento`, `operaciones`, `reportes`).

## Conversation 67884311-645c-4f5a-ae15-979d81d75006: Fixing Duplicate Contract Notes
- Created: 2026-04-10T02:43:06Z
- Last modified: 2026-04-11T06:03:31Z

### USER Objective:
Stabilizing Agua Fiscal Sanitation

The user's objective is to complete the stabilization of the Agua web application by implementing a robust, auditable financial sanitation system. Key goals include:
1. Finalizing the consolidation of reporting architecture by retiring legacy files and enforcing V2 standards.
2. Developing an administrative "Saneamiento Administrativo" control panel with mandatory filters (status, period, category) to perform surgical, non-destructive fiscal adjustments.
3. Implementing a "Batch ID" system for all mass sanitation operations to ensure full auditability and traceability in the `cambios` table.
4. Hardening the data synchronization pipeline (Host B to C) to automatically sanitize "Estado 4" (Definitive Suspension) contracts while reserving manual control for other statuses.
5. Refining the sanitation bitácora to provide professional, printable audit trails for financial adjustments.

## Conversation a966039d-cd86-440d-b61b-0788fab82e28: Agua Contract Logic Stabilization
- Created: 2026-04-10T16:49:29Z
- Last modified: 2026-04-10T21:59:03Z

### USER Objective:
Stabilizing Agua Contract Logic

The user's objective is to stabilize the Agua web application by implementing automated financial saneamiento, enforcing strict contract state transitions, and improving auditability. Key goals include:
1. Implementing the "Amnistía de Recargos" (Regla C06) for contract reactivation to prevent punitive debt accumulation.
2. Strengthening audit trails in `regresarCargoCancelado` (Regla F03) with operator logging and state validation.
3. Enhancing the UI with a read-only infrastructure reference panel for contract edits.
4. Formalizing a standardized session closure and documentation protocol (Regla 09) to ensure all verified changes are automatically committed to the `agua_chatledger` repository, maintaining architectural consistency across both Gemini and Claude Code environments.

## Conversation 24485b9b-f530-4a20-8ea3-585e551c238f: Stabilizing User Search Filters
- Created: 2026-04-09T04:59:38Z
- Last modified: 2026-04-10T02:20:05Z

### USER Objective:
Stabilizing Agua Financial Saneamiento

The user's objective is to stabilize the Agua web application by refactoring contract status logic and implementing a robust, web-based financial saneamiento system. Key goals include:
1. Implementing defensive coding to enforce logical contract state transitions and prevent "Avalancha Punitiva" and "Deuda Zombi".
2. Developing a centralized, parameter-driven administrative dashboard (`admin/saneamiento/`) for historical data cleanup (2018-2026), specifically targeting "Cargos Fantasma".
3. Ensuring all saneamiento operations include audit trails and rollback capabilities via a new `batch_id` column to maintain fiscal integrity during the migration to the V2 schema.
4. Organizing project assets and infrastructure within a dedicated `feature/saneamiento-v2` branch to ensure consistency with Host C migration requirements while maintaining a clean, modular codebase.

## Conversation bdc4ae35-3174-4334-aa14-a427816e51bc: Migrating Assembly V2 Webapp
- Created: 2026-04-08T17:39:02Z
- Last modified: 2026-04-09T04:20:54Z

### USER Objective:
Finalizing Asamblea V2 Attendance Integration

The user's objective is to finalize the standalone 'Asamblea V2' module by ensuring the attendance registration and reporting workflows are fully functional and compatible with the legacy system. Key goals include:
1. UI/UX Refinement: Improving the admin grid layout and action button styling.
2. Data Integrity: Ensuring multi-contract users are correctly grouped in the attendance list and ticket generation, while maintaining the legacy TXT report format for compatibility with the existing `asistencias.php` import process.
3. System Synchronization: Verifying that the generated attendance TXT files remain compatible with the legacy `core.php` processing logic to prevent integration errors.
4. Architectural Consolidation: Maintaining the `agua_chatledger` repository as the definitive source of truth for all project documentation and configuration, utilizing symlinks to ensure consistency across development environments.

### Thinking

**Analyzing File Discrepancies**

I've confirmed the existence of `admin/saneamiento/verif_depuracion_cargos_estado4.php`. But the user requested specifics on `auditoria_recargos_suspendidos.php`, which isn't the direct target. It appears the refactor `a151c8a` might be key to uncovering the relevant code and purpose, perhaps this file was changed in the refactor.


**Clarifying File Purpose**

I've determined the file's original intent: to audit "Phantom Debt" within suspended contracts, supporting "Saneamiento Administrativo." I need to determine the user's intent: restore the file with the old name or just understand its function. The phrase "recuperalo para ti" suggests a request for analysis. I'm reviewing the last three conversations to provide context on the file's purpose: contract status transitions, menu migration, and debt sanitation.

<summary>System Message</summary>

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time. The exception is if the task is trivially simple.
2. After your research is complete, ask the user any open questions using the ask_question tool. Don't use the tool to ask trivial questions like 'should I proceed?'.
3. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true`. The user must approve the plan before you are allowed to proceed.
4. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
5. Verify any work that you have done.
6. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

## Agent Response

### Thinking

**Analyzing the File's Purpose**

I've got the content and will summarize its function considering the prior interactions. The user requested I "recover it for you" and "determine its purpose," which I'll do by presenting an analysis showing I've found it and the intended use. The file reveals details on how it was used to analyze the file.
