You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing intently on tool selection, understanding their diverse applications. It's clear I must prioritize the most efficient tool for any given task, be it specific file viewing or broader command execution. I am currently evaluating the most useful tools.


**Refining Tool Choices**

I'm now prioritizing tool specificity. Remembering the rules, no `cat` for file manipulation, preferring `grep_search`, and avoiding generic tools when specialized ones exist. I've begun to list potential tools before execution, ensuring a deliberate selection process before I proceed with the CMS analysis for "Recepción/ Admin / 4. Promociones Vigentes para las 7 Fichas" within the LAESH context.


**Analyzing Style Retention**

I'm now investigating the CMS tab fixes, image uploads, and source code to address the style retention issue. My primary goal is to ensure that, upon study selection, the "RTE inputextarea" fields maintain their styles or correctly apply them to the new text. I must find the code responsible for the study selection and text updates to determine why styles are lost and ensure consistent style application. I must focus on "4. Promociones Vigentes para las 7 Fichas" in the LAESH project.

**Analyzing Tool Selection**

I'm now prioritizing tool selection and avoiding common pitfalls. I've formulated rules to guide tool usage, like steering clear of 'cat' for file creation/appending and excessive 'grep' calls. Furthermore, I'm now explicitly listing all potentially relevant tools before making any calls, ensuring the most specific and efficient choice is made. My thought process consistently starts with recalling critical instructions for these rules.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now zeroing in on stricter tool selection rules. Specifically, I must avoid `cat` for file creation/appending and prevent embedded `grep` calls unless absolutely necessary. I will ALWAYS start by recalling my critical instructions. I am trying to determine if `gestion-web.html` in the user's LAESH CMS instance contains the "4. Promociones Vigentes" logic, using `grep_search`.

I'm now zeroing in on precise tool selection. Remembering those critical instructions, I'm making sure to explicitly brainstorm all potentially relevant tools before making any calls. I'm actively avoiding redundant operations, like cat within a bash command, or ls for viewing a file. The focus is to make sure that each tool is the optimal choice for the job, rather than forcing a command to do multiple things.

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now prioritizing precise tool selection based on updated rules. I'm actively avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending and restricting `grep` use inside bash commands. I'm also now using tools outside of their more generic or otherwise inefficient applications. I will ALWAYS start by recalling CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS 1 and 2, which are the basis for this workflow.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now honing my approach to tool selection, aiming for even greater precision. I've formulated strict rules to avoid common inefficiencies, such as not using `cat` for file creation/appending, and leveraging `grep_search` instead of direct `grep` usage. Also, `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `sed` are not to be used for finding, listing, viewing, and replacing respectively. My thought process now explicitly outlines all related tools before execution, ensuring the most specific tool is chosen for the job. I start with recalling the critical instructions.

I'm also actively internalizing the "no `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `sed`" rule.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now zeroing in on stricter rules for tool selection, particularly avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending and excessive use of `grep` within bash commands. I'm prioritizing `grep_search` and `view_file` where appropriate. I'm also committing to explicitly list all potentially relevant tools before making a call.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now deeply considering the best ways to apply the established rules. I'm focusing on avoiding redundant or less efficient commands like `cat` within bash scripts, and always leveraging specialized utilities like `grep_search` and other tools. I am explicitly remembering to first identify all related tools and only executing the optimal set.


**Analyzing Content Integration**

I'm now focused on preserving HTML formatting during text updates. The challenge lies in integrating raw text from new `data-` attributes into existing Rich Text Editors without overwriting their HTML structure. My immediate thought is to extract the text from the incoming data and inject it within the existing HTML wrapper, rather than replacing the wrapper entirely. I am also investigating the `item.key` variable, suspecting it corresponds to the RTE instance and attempting to determine whether it is possible to identify it.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on stricter tool selection rules. Remembering those crucial instructions, I'm aiming to avoid `cat`, `grep` within commands, and `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `sed` when there are better choices. Before any tool call, I'm explicitly listing related tools and only executing a set if others are less suitable. For example, considering the RTE fields in `gestion-web.html`, I must determine the best tool to use.

I'm now examining the JavaScript code in `gestion-web.js` to understand how the variables `nombre`, `categoria`, `ayuno`, `tiempo`, and `detalle` are handled. These variables seem linked to specific data fields on the page. The use of `setData` suggests a potential connection to rich text editors, which is something I need to keep in mind, and verify if it influences the RTE fields in `gestion-web.html`. I'll analyze how these are handled to get more context.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. Remembering my instructions, I'm avoiding `cat`, `ls`, `grep`, and `sed` unless absolutely necessary. I need to explicitly list potential tools before execution, choosing only the most appropriate. I've located the relevant PHP file and the CKEditor initialization script. The issue is focused on `gestion-web`.


**Analyzing Style Preservation**

I'm now grappling with style preservation in the CKEditor update. The `setData()` method overwrites existing styles when updating the editor content based on the study selection. I need to figure out how to merge the new text with the existing styling in CKEditor 5. The key is to replace the old text while maintaining the HTML wrappers and inline styling.


**Investigating Text Replacement**

I'm now investigating text replacement techniques within CKEditor 5. I realize simply using `setData()` is insufficient, as expected. I'm considering several approaches. One involves parsing existing HTML and replacing text nodes, although the complexity of multiple nodes presents a challenge. Another approach utilizes CKEditor's model API to retain attributes during text insertion. However, because it's a CMS, I will read the HTML, extract the inner text, and wrap the new text with the previous HTML structure.



**Simplifying HTML Manipulation**

I've realized a significantly easier approach for HTML manipulation. Instead of complex parsing or DOM traversal, I'll leverage simpler methods within the HTML. The core idea is to retrieve the `innerHTML`, identify the text, and replace it. CKEditor 5 offers an even simpler path: select all content, copy the attributes from the first text node, delete the selection, and insert the updated text, preserving styles and structure.


**Evaluating Text Node Extraction**

I'm now evaluating text node extraction using either CKEditor's model API or direct HTML manipulation. I'm exploring accessing existing attributes, especially from the first text node, for preservation during updates. The alternative, string manipulation, is proving too brittle, even with the proposed regex replacement. My immediate focus is determining if the structure supports simpler HTML-based element extraction, which might simplify style preservation significantly.


**Implementing Text Insertion**

I'm now implementing the text insertion. I've been examining the proposed JavaScript function and simplifying its design. This function uses a temporary `div` to parse HTML. It aims to locate the deepest element, replacing its `textContent` with the new text while preserving the existing structure, including inline styles. It works smoothly with nested elements and handles cases where there are no children. The remaining question is how to use it with the CKEditor API.


**Optimizing Element Selection**

I'm now refining the element selection within the HTML update function. I've realized a potential issue with multiple top-level elements like multiple paragraphs. If the old HTML is not empty and consists of multiple elements, the function should replace the *entire* inner HTML, not just the text of the first element. I'm focusing on handling these cases robustly, ensuring that the updated HTML reflects the intended replacement across all elements, preserving the general styles.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.

I'm now zeroing in on optimizing tool selection. I've integrated stricter rules to avoid common pitfalls like using `cat` inside bash and inefficient `grep` usage. My focus is on making choices that maximize efficiency and that will result in more organized responses. I'm actively thinking through the tools that would be required for all stages of a task.


**Planning Implementation Strategies**

I'm currently focused on formulating a clear implementation plan. The goal is to address the issue of style loss when updating CKEditor instances. Instead of directly writing the code, I'm leaning toward creating an `implementation_plan.md` artifact. This would offer a concise analysis, and then seek feedback before implementation, and would avoid possible errors in the code.

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now honing my tool selection process based on two critical instructions. First, I recall the rules: no `cat` for file creation/appending, `grep_search` is preferred, and avoid generic tools like `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, and `sed` unless essential. Secondly, before tool calls, I'll list related tools to ensure I choose the most suitable options. The user wants to know if the text styles persist in the database.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now incorporating specific rules to refine my tool selection process. I'm focusing on avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending, preferring `grep_search` to embedded `grep` commands, and generally avoiding `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, and `sed` for their basic functionalities. I am also remembering to explicitly list all potentially relevant tools before making a tool call. I'm trying to identify how text styling is stored for each study.


**Investigating Content Structure**

I'm now investigating the structure of promotional content within the database, specifically focusing on how individual study descriptions are organized. It seems the main "Promociones Vigentes" text has entries with sub-sections for each day of the week. I need to determine where the catalog of all studies resides, potentially in the `estudios` or `catalogo_estudios` tables, to answer the user's question about text styling persistence. I am checking if there is any HTML in the value_texto column for these sections within the web_contenidos table.

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now implementing strict rules regarding tool selection, particularly avoiding `cat` for file creation and `grep` within bash. My focus is on direct, more efficient tools. I'm working to systematically list potential tools for each task before execution, ensuring a deliberate and optimal choice. I'm recalling the importance of the critical instructions.


**Analyzing Data Structure**

My focus has shifted to the `web_contenidos` table and how it handles data, specifically the `promo_titulo` field and its interaction with CKEditor. I'm investigating whether the backend stores HTML directly from the editor within `valor_texto`. I need to understand this to determine how styling is preserved or handled during data storage and retrieval. I am particularly curious about the implications of the backend's data handling when saving and retrieving the data entered from the form with the `promo_titulo` values.


**Investigating CMS Data Handling**

I'm now zeroing in on how the CMS specifically handles data input from CKEditor. My recent findings suggest the system directly stores CKEditor-generated HTML in the `web_contenidos` table. The plain text I observed in a previous dump now makes sense; it likely reflects instances where no styling was applied, or the dump was taken before styling was applied. Examining `gestion_web.php` confirmed this, with the field naming convention `promo_titulo_<?= $pId ?>` indicating the persistence of HTML input. I'm focusing on validating this through a combination of observations.


**Confirming Style Persistence**

I've confirmed that the `web_contenidos` table definitely stores HTML. I'm now certain the style applied to promotion day entries is persisted. I'm focusing on the interaction between the combo box and CKEditor. The raw study data is pulled when a study is selected, potentially overwriting any existing HTML styling, as I see it now. I'm understanding this is what gives each promotion day its individual style. The catalog itself does not have HTML. I am confident that the style is preserved in the table.

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing intently on tool selection, understanding their diverse applications. It's clear I must prioritize the most efficient tool for any given task, be it specific file viewing or broader command execution. I am currently evaluating the most useful tools.


**Refining Tool Choices**

I'm now deeply immersed in refining my tool selection process, adhering strictly to the principle of specificity. I'm actively avoiding redundant use of commands. I'm focusing on the explicit listing of relevant tools before execution, and only executing the optimal tool set. My focus is now on editing the file `/home/carlos/GitHub/caelitandem_home/restaurantb/www/laesh-web-assets-uipv1a/js/gestion-web.js`. I am reviewing the target content for replacement.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on precise tool choices. Recall: I should never use `cat` inside a Bash command to make or append files, and always use `grep_search` where appropriate. Plus, never use `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, or `sed` for those particular tasks. Before running tools, I need to list them all first. For my next action, I'm using `replace_file_content` to modify a JavaScript file.


**Analyzing Code Transformation**

I'm now deeply analyzing this new code block. My goal is to add functionality from the old block to the new one. I intend to use `replace_file_content` to replace the old code block, incorporating the new enhancements to maintain functionality while improving clarity and maintainability. This will involve breaking down the logic and ensuring each section has its proper place.


**Evaluating Code Extraction**

I'm now thoroughly evaluating this new code extraction and identifying its role in the larger system. My aim is to extract the relevant snippets from the old code block, and integrate it into the new code in an efficient manner. Using the tools I have, I am confident I can do this and keep all functionality.

Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Analyzing Tool Usage**

I'm now prioritizing tool selection with a strict set of rules. I'm actively avoiding 'cat' for file creation/appending and 'grep' within bash commands. I am also avoiding other similar common but less efficient utilities. I must recall that I need to list all tools relevant to a task before executing a set of tools. I am now applying this new mindset to analyze the new issues.


**Assessing Feature Viability**

I'm now deep-diving into the CKEditor 5 configuration. There's a styling issue with the "ck-promo-day" field; the preview and publication are also broken. Additionally, I need to modify the font size and font family options in the toolbar. The current configuration uses descriptive words and lacks numerical font sizes, and specific font names. The task is to analyze the feasibility of changing font sizes and font families, without making any alterations yet.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now implementing strict rules regarding tool selection, particularly avoiding `cat` for file manipulation and emphasizing `grep_search`. I'm also now pre-emptively listing all relevant tools before executing any. I'm actively thinking before any action, and evaluating the relative merits of any given tool to a more specialized option. I am ensuring that the correct tool is selected for each job, according to a list of specified rules. I will be reviewing the tool selection for the task at hand.

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. Remembering the critical instructions, I’m building a mental checklist of related tools before executing anything. This includes avoiding `cat` in specific contexts and leveraging `grep_search` whenever feasible. This ensures I'm picking the most appropriate tool for each step, and not using some tools in a manner that's not optimal.

<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

**Analyzing Tool Selection**

I've been refining my approach to tool selection based on those critical instructions. I'm actively avoiding redundant commands within bash. My focus is now on meticulously listing all potential tools for a task before executing any. I'm also double-checking frontend file paths, and making sure the information that I need is as accurate as possible.

**Refining Efficiency Guidelines**

I've been refining my approach to tool selection based on those critical instructions, particularly avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending and excessive use of `grep` within bash commands. I am also recalling the importance of first explicitly listing all potential tools before executing. For example, I'm thinking about the correct tools to use for processing array data, especially concerning the `$draftRow` and `$promos` arrays, to maximize efficiency.

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

<bash_command_reminder>
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection protocols. Considering Critical Instructions 1 and 2, I'm avoiding `cat`, internal `grep`, and `ls` for their specific functions. Now, I'm focusing on directly identifying the "promociones" rendering in `index.php`. My search aims to pinpoint the exact code block handling the promotions.

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection criteria as I'm analyzing `website/index.php`. Remember those critical instructions? I am keeping them in mind. The new rule is to explicitly list all potentially related tools *before* executing a set. Now, I'm using `grep_search` to pinpoint the rendering of "Promociones" within the main file, a much more targeted approach than I had previously considered.

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection criteria based on Critical Instructions 1 and 2. I'm focusing on avoiding `cat`, `grep` within bash commands, and inefficient tool pairings. I've identified the front-end files: `gestion-web.html` and `gestion-web.js`. Now, I'm examining how to apply this to the text style of the "RTE de Título / Etiqueta Superior de la Ficha" section.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now zeroing in on avoiding `cat` for file manipulation, and favoring more specific tools like `grep_search`. I'm also actively remembering to consider the full range of relevant tools before making a choice, ensuring that each decision is based on a thoughtful review of available options. I'm scrutinizing instances where generic tools might be used when more specialized alternatives exist.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection rules to boost efficiency, avoiding common pitfalls like using `cat` needlessly. I'm prioritizing `grep_search` and other specialized tools over generic shell commands. Before executing, I'm carefully listing related tools, executing a set only after ruling out alternatives. This focused approach is being applied even to simple PHP code, like extracting `$diaNombre`.


**Analyzing Tag Removal**

I've discovered that both `gestion_web.php` and `promociones.php` employ `strip_tags` on `$p['dia_semana']`, which is a key observation. To address the issue, I need to remove this function call from both files. Specifically, I've identified the problematic textarea in `gestion_web.php` and determined that removing `strip_tags` within it will solve the problem in the frontend, but I'll make sure there are not unintended consequences within that file. I am also checking all instances of the variable in the code.


**Evaluating Output Format**

Now, I'm carefully evaluating the output format of `$diaNombre` within `promociones.php`. I've realized its HTML content, originating from the RTE, needs raw output to preserve formatting. This raw output avoids unwanted HTML escaping. I'm focusing on ensuring data integrity while considering various input scenarios in this file. I have identified the need to refine this PHP code.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on stricter tool selection rules. Remembering those critical instructions is key! I'm actively avoiding redundant tool nesting – no `cat` inside bash, no generic `grep` usage. I'm also now pre-planning potential tools before execution, ensuring the chosen set is the most specific. I'm looking at how `_createEditorNoMedia` and `_createEditor` are defined to see why the font size is missing.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Analyzing Tool Selection**

I've been refining my approach to tool selection based on those critical instructions. I'm actively avoiding redundant commands within bash and prioritizing specialized tools like `grep_search`. I'm now explicitly listing related tools before any execution, ensuring I choose the most suitable option. Recently, I was examining `ckeditor-init.js` and have been prioritizing specific tools.


**Considering Font Size Options**

I'm now contemplating how to integrate numerical font sizes into the CKEditor 5 configuration. The existing setup uses word-based sizes; the challenge is whether to add numerical sizes, replace the existing options array with numerical sizes, or both. I am considering replacing the default options with numerical values to align with the user's explicit preference for standard numerical sizes.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Analyzing Tool Limitations**

I am now delving into tool usage limitations. Remembering the rules, especially about avoiding `cat` for file creation and `grep` inside bash commands, is paramount. I'm focusing on pre-planning the tools required, ensuring I list all related utilities before executing. Additionally, I am addressing an issue where HTML tags are stripped from a specific label in PHP, meaning styling applied through CKEditor is lost on save or rendering.


**Implementing HTML Adjustments**

I've made progress on removing `strip_tags` in specific PHP files (`gestion_web.php` and `promociones.php`) to retain CKEditor styling. However, I've kept it for `dia_semana` due to URL and data attribute integrity. I'm also working on enhancing the CKEditor configuration in `ckeditor-init.js`. I am adding numeric font sizes and additional standard fonts to the dropdowns in the editor, in both `_createEditor` and `_createEditorNoMedia`.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection criteria as per the guidelines. I'm focusing on avoiding `cat` for file manipulation and emphasizing `grep_search` instead of embedded `grep`. I am also applying rules for what tools to avoid. Before execution, I must also explicitly list relevant tools, validating their appropriateness. I'm taking the feedback into account, and focusing on an analysis of impacts before changes, starting with `strip_tags()`.


**Analyzing `strip_tags()` Impact**

I'm now diving into the impact analysis for removing `strip_tags()` from `dia_semana`. My focus is on understanding why it was originally included. Examining `promociones.php` and `gestion_web.php` reveals the function's use in various contexts. Specifically, the display and handling of day names and their presentation in the CMS are being considered for potential implications of removal.


**Evaluating HTML Handling**

I'm now carefully examining the implications of allowing HTML in `dia_semana`. I've revisited the potential scenarios in the existing code. While `$diaLabel` and image placeholders appear safe, the rendering in `sections/promociones.php` raises a concern. Rendering HTML directly within the `catalog-card-day` div might cause layout issues. This is the area requiring the most attention, since changes can cause UI disruptions.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. I'm actively avoiding redundant tool usage like `cat` for file creation and `grep` inside bash commands. The emphasis is on direct application of specialized tools for viewing, searching, listing, and replacing. The next step will require a more explicit process of listing all related tools before making calls.


**Analyzing Style Conflict**

I'm now grappling with a style conflict. Injecting HTML from CKEditor could break the `.catalog-card-day` CSS. The user wants RTE styles on "Título / Etiqueta Superior de la Ficha," but that field is part of the `catalog-card-day`. The current front-end output for `.catalog-card-day` might strip tags. This contradicts the desire for RTE styles in publication. The user's intent is unclear; they ask for "Estilos," implying RTE styles.

**Refining Execution Protocols**

I'm now implementing strict guidelines to optimize tool usage. I'm avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending and restricting `grep` within bash. Additionally, I'm eliminating `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, and `sed` for specific, non-generic tasks. I'm focusing on pre-planning tool selection before execution to adhere to the plan approved by the user. I'm starting by recalling crucial instructions.


**Analyzing Impact Thoroughly**

My analysis now extends to address a specific user request and its potential ramifications. The user's input demands that I execute a solution with careful consideration for impact, which is currently focused on how stripping `dia_semana` in a few key locations will impact surrounding features. I've pinpointed multiple areas where this could cause issues: `<img>`, CMS header text, `gestion_web.php` textarea, and `promociones.php`. I'm evaluating solutions like CSS adjustments to handle potential layout issues caused by block elements within inline-block elements. I must keep the RTE editable option in mind.

In particular, I must avoid using `cat` for file creation and appending, and `grep` within bash commands unless unavoidable. I've analyzed a specific file (`gestion_web.php`) and line to ensure proper code modification.

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now deeply considering the best tools for file manipulation and searching, remembering to avoid unnecessary 'cat' calls and internal 'grep' commands. I am actively working to avoid 'ls', 'cat', 'grep', and 'sed' where more appropriate alternatives exist. For this specific file, I am thinking through all related tools before making any calls. I am starting to apply these rules to `/home/carlos/GitHub/caelitandem_home/restaurantb/www/laesh-swbldi/website/sections/promociones.php`.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now deeply immersed in refining tool selection based on several rules, remembering to never use `cat` improperly, always prioritize `grep_search`, and avoid using `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, and `sed` for their basic functions. I am also recalling the critical instructions before making tool calls, ensuring I explicitly list relevant tools and execute a set only if they are the most specific options available. Currently, I am about to add a CSS fix to `landing.css` to manage a potential layout issue.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. Remembering the critical instructions, I've eliminated redundant use cases. I've successfully implemented all changes I set out to make. First, I removed `strip_tags` in `gestion_web.php`. Then, I removed `strip_tags` in `website/sections/promociones.php`. Finally, I protected the frontend layout by implementing a CSS rule.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now prioritizing direct tool choices based on specific criteria to avoid common pitfalls. Recall, I must never use cat to create or append, nor grep within bash unless absolutely necessary, and avoid ls, cat, grep, and sed for their basic functions. The current focus is on selecting appropriate tools to address a CKEditor initialization failure and its resulting HTML display issues.


**Diagnosing JavaScript Errors**

I've isolated the problem to a probable JavaScript error within `ckeditor-init.js`, resulting in textareas instead of the WYSIWYG editor. My focus is now on the recent additions made to the `fontFamily` and `fontSize` options within the configuration of the CKEditor. I'm investigating how those changes might have introduced a syntax error or caused a configuration misstep that crashes the editor during initialization.


**Investigating Config Options**

I'm now zeroing in on the interaction between font-size configuration and the CKEditor 5 plugins. The crucial question: could numeric font size options trigger an initialization error? I must verify whether numeric values are valid, because it could be that my options should be strings instead. Also, I'm checking the plugin list to see if the font plugin is included. It is!

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Analyzing Runtime Failure**

My focus is now on the runtime failure of CKEditor. I've re-reviewed the recently added JavaScript code, specifically the `fontSize` configuration. Since `node -c` validated the JS syntax, the issue likely stems from a runtime conflict during initialization. This points to a configuration problem, rather than a syntax error. I will double-check the integration.


**Investigating Font Size Errors**

I'm now zeroing in on the font size configuration. It looks like mixing numerical and string options in `fontSize.options` could be the culprit. CKEditor 5 appears very picky about the format. Specifically, using numbers directly in `fontSize.options` requires careful UI configuration, or it results in "font-size-invalid-option" errors. It seems that mixing numbers and strings in the options isn't as straightforward as I initially thought.


**Clarifying Font Size Options**

I'm now clarifying the root issue with font size options. It turns out that mixing named presets like 'tiny' with numerical values in `fontSize.options` is a recipe for disaster. The plugin cannot handle the conflicting strategies. However, I'm now considering how to manage text formatted with the legacy classes if we switch solely to numerical values. I'm exploring the implications for any existing content.


**Refining Font Size Mapping**

I'm now refining the font size mapping strategy. I've realized CKEditor 5's behavior depends entirely on how `fontSize.options` are defined. Specifically, the old default, using strings like 'tiny', will produce classes. Now I am pondering whether to transform the old classes to the new styles with a map, but the default might output inline styles anyway.


**Exploring Font Size Configuration**

I'm now investigating font size configuration further. It appears the `FontSize` plugin outputs inline styles, despite my initial assumption of class-based presets for named options like 'tiny'. Now, I'm thinking about the implications of the default font size and how to best manage old content. Specifically, I'm wondering if mixing named presets and numbers in `fontSize.options` is even possible, and if it is, how to configure the UI to show both number-based styles and legacy preset words in the dropdown.


**Interpreting User Requirements**

I'm now clarifying the user's requirements. The phrase "muestre numeros los que ya tiene" suggests they expect numerical font sizes, which deviates from my initial assumptions about their existing configuration. This leads me to question whether their current setup already uses numbers or if they're simply requesting the existing options be displayed numerically. I need to get a clear picture of their baseline and desired behavior.


**Testing Numerical Replacement**

I am now testing a hypothesis: replacing the mixed font size options array with a clean numerical array, alongside 'default', will resolve the crash. I'm focusing on the font size configuration and setting a direct numerical array plus 'default', to eliminate the chance of a mixed array causing the runtime conflict. The next step is a test. I am curious whether this will work without changing anything in `fontFamily`.

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection based on precise instructions. I'm avoiding `cat` for file creation and `grep` inside bash, always opting for more appropriate tools like `grep_search`. I'm rigorously listing potential tools before execution, and prioritizing the best fit. I've successfully resolved a CKEditor 5 crash caused by mixing class-based and inline font size presets. The solution involved removing named string presets and using numerical values.

**Clarifying Font Combinations**

I'm now considering the potential issues with font combinations. Specifically, I must clarify to the user whether mixing original and additional font files in the designed combinations will cause errors. I'm actively considering critical instructions one and two before making a call.


**Analyzing Font Handling**

I've examined how Editor 5 handles font families. The `fontFamily.options` array accepts strings, including comma-separated generic font families. CKEditor 5 uses inline CSS styles for font-family, which means no conflicts arise when using original or additional font files. I'm focusing on clarifying how this impacts the user's design choices.

I'm now zeroing in on stricter tool selection rules. Remembering those critical instructions, I must explicitly list potential tools before execution. My focus is avoiding nested commands like the plague. For example, never use `cat` to create or append; `grep_search` is preferred over nested `grep`. The goal is to maximize the utility and precision of each tool for this project.

**Analyzing HTML Output**

I'm now diving into `gestion_web.php`. I see a vulnerability: the `descripcion` field isn't sanitizing HTML tags before being displayed in the textarea. I'm also puzzled by the styling issue, specifically the text centering not working, though it works elsewhere in the CMS. I'm reviewing the code for a possible cause.


**Investigating Alignment Discrepancies**

I've discovered the root cause of the alignment issue. It appears the alignment feature in CKEditor 5 relies on CSS classes like `.text-align-center`. These are present within the CMS because it includes CKEditor's default CSS. However, the preview and publication views don't, which explains why the alignment isn't working there. To resolve this, I need to include CKEditor's CSS or define those specific classes in the frontend's CSS to ensure consistent alignment.


**Resolving Style Consistency**

I'm now zeroing in on a simpler solution: adding the missing CSS classes to `landing.css`. I've determined this is the most straightforward way to ensure CKEditor alignment functions as intended in the preview and published views. I also noted that other style elements, particularly text and background colors, rely on inline styles.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection criteria based on Critical Instructions 1 and 2. I'm focusing on avoiding `cat`, `grep` and `ls` within bash commands. My thought process is now centered on explicitly listing related tools before selecting the optimal toolset, ensuring a more targeted and less generic approach. Specifically, I'm analyzing CSS and how inline styles may or may not be overridden by existing classes.


**Investigating Style Conflicts**

I'm now diving into the style conflict, focusing on why style changes aren't reflected in the preview or publication. My current train of thought centers on whether the HTML tags are being stripped during the loading process. I'm checking `index.php` to understand how the `descripcion` variable is handled, specifically looking for any tag-stripping operations. The focus is on finding any potential causes of the formatting issues.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Analyzing Tool Usage**

I've been examining my tool usage, adhering to strict rules: no `cat` for file creation/appending, `grep_search` preferred over embedded `grep`, and avoiding `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, and `sed` for their primary functions. I am trying to stick to these instructions in all scenarios. I start each new thought with the critical instructions. I am starting to look at CKEditor 5 docs, as well.


**Considering Frontend Integration**

I'm now thinking about how CKEditor 5's output integrates with the frontend. I've noticed that features like alignment and styles rely on specific CSS classes, such as `text-align-center` and `.acerca-h3b`. I need to ensure the frontend CSS includes these classes to render the content correctly. The frontend might need updates to provide the appropriate styles.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now implementing strict rules regarding tool selection, particularly avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending, and `grep` within bash commands unless necessary. I'm focusing on always explicitly listing relevant tools before execution and ensuring the chosen set is the most efficient. I have determined that a missing `text-align-center` style confirms that a CKEditor 5 utility is the root cause of the "alignment not working" issue.


**Analyzing Style Collisions**

I'm now investigating potential conflicts between CKEditor's styles and the frontend's styles. I've decided to add CKEditor's basic alignment and font-size CSS utility classes to `landing.css` as a first step. I need to check for other potential style collisions by comparing the specificity of the styles. For example, if a user changes the color of the text to red (which applies `style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"`), then I must determine why it wouldn't work. I am checking the CSS specificity for `.catalog-card-rte-desc`.


**Clarifying Style Precedence**

I've just been analyzing the CSS specificity to determine how inline styles from CKEditor's font color feature interact with existing styles, particularly in regards to the `<strong>` tag. I've concluded that the `span`'s inline style always takes precedence if it's inside the `strong` tag. However, if the `span` is outside the `strong` tag, the `strong` tag's explicit color will be preferred. This behavior will dictate how I address potential style conflicts.


**Resolving Style Conflicts**

I'm now determining how to address the color style conflict, specifically around the `.catalog-card-rte-desc strong` class and its hardcoded color. The plan is to either remove this hardcoded color or make it conditional. I will also analyze any global resets that might strip styles. I'm investigating how CKEditor handles alignment – is it classes or inline styles? I found that CKEditor 5 uses classes by default, so I'll add those to `landing.css`, along with font size classes.


**Expanding Style Coverage**

I'm now focusing on ensuring that CKEditor's standard classes are available to style the RTE content. I've identified the specific classes related to text size and alignment that need to be incorporated into `landing.css`. I'm confirming it's the right file, no imports. I've switched my approach, and I will prepare a diagnostic for the user based on the issues found, per their request.


**Identifying Potential Collisions**

I'm now investigating a potential styling conflict within `promociones.php`, specifically concerning the `.catalog-card-day` class. I've realized that the `display: inline;` declaration for the paragraph tag, when combined with `text-align: center`, will prevent proper centering, as inline elements don't respect the `text-align` property. I need to review and rectify this collision.


**Refining Conflict Resolution**

I'm now zeroing in on resolving the conflict within `.catalog-card-day`. It seems that the current `display: inline;` declaration on the `<p>` tag is the root cause of the centering issue, since it fails to respect `text-align: center`. My proposed solution is to modify this to `display: block;` on the `<p>` element, and removing inline styles. Furthermore, I have found that `.catalog-card-rte-desc b, .catalog-card-rte-desc strong` hardcodes the color, so I will either remove it, or reset it.


**Summarizing Key Diagnoses**

I'm now consolidating the root causes identified. The core issue with the alignment is that CKEditor utilizes CSS classes (like "text-align-center") not present in the public stylesheet. My earlier "Monday Title" fix, with `display: inline;` on paragraphs within `.catalog-card-day`, is preventing text centering because `inline` elements don't respect `text-align`. Additionally, the `.catalog-card-rte-desc strong` class in `landing.css` has a hardcoded color, causing conflict with user-applied styling.


**Implementing Complete Fixes**

I am now implementing a comprehensive plan to resolve the identified issues. First, I'll inject CKEditor's utility classes (e.g., `.text-align-center`, `.text-huge`) into `landing.css` to align the frontend with the CMS's WYSIWYG formatting. Next, I'll remove the `display: inline;` restriction for the "Monday Title" to ensure text centering works correctly. Finally, I will resolve the color hierarchy conflict within `.catalog-card-rte-desc` by allowing the color to be inherited.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now honing my tool selection process based on two critical instructions. I'm focusing on avoiding redundant or less efficient tool combinations. For example, I need to prevent the unnecessary use of `cat` within bash commands or `grep` inside other commands. I'm also attempting to create a complete list of relevant tools before selecting the best option, and trying to focus on `alignment`. I need to ensure the best method is used to configure the CKEditor 5 alignment plugin.


**Investigating Alignment Options**

I'm deep-diving into CKEditor 5's alignment configurations. I discovered the default uses classes, which is relevant to the issue. Inline styles are not easily configured, without custom upcasters or downcasters, or a newer version build. I need to check the documentation for alignment inline styles in CKEditor 5. I will see if a custom plugin is needed.


**Tracing the Bug Source**

I'm now tracing the bug. It appears the CKEditor always outputted `class="text-align-center"` by default, confirmed by a `git log` on `ckeditor-init.js`. The issue likely lies elsewhere. Examining `git diff` outputs, I found that the `display: inline;` style was added to `p` elements within the `.catalog-card-day` class, which may have impacted alignment, and this was not in the file 3 days prior.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection criteria based on new guidelines. Remembering those critical instructions, I am working towards a more disciplined approach: No `cat` for file creation, always `grep_search` where appropriate, avoiding general-purpose commands for specific tasks. I'm focusing on pre-planning the tools required, and always critically evaluating each tool's relevance before execution. I'm also remembering to analyze and explore Git history and CKEditor for potential conflicts.


**Investigating Potential Conflicts**

I'm now investigating potential conflicts, specifically regarding styling within the CKEditor and how it integrates with the frontend. I've ruled out a couple of initial assumptions about CKEditor's default behavior and missing CSS references. My current hypothesis centers on a discrepancy between the CMS preview (which includes CKEditor styling) and the public site, which likely doesn't. This seems like a frequent point of confusion, and I'm also considering color inconsistencies.


**Verifying CKEditor Behavior**

I'm now deep-diving into CKEditor 5's alignment behavior. It seems the `.catalog-card-rte-desc strong` style is overriding my intended color in "Descripción." I was hoping CKEditor could output inline styles for alignment, which would resolve a conflict without modifying `landing.css`. While older versions may have allowed inline styling, CKEditor 5 defaults to classes. I'm verifying this claim and exploring if a custom plugin is needed.


**Confirming Alignment Issue**

I've confirmed my suspicion that CKEditor 5 uses classes for alignment, specifically `.text-align-center`. I investigated further and verified through comprehensive project-wide searches that this class has NEVER existed in our codebase's CSS files, particularly `landing.css`. This is critical. The user's perception of centered text was likely a misinterpretation of CMS preview behavior; I believe it never appeared on the live site.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. I'm actively avoiding redundant operations and inefficient commands, as per the rules. Critical Instruction 1 and 2 are always top of mind. Now, I'm specifically assessing available tools and prioritizing the most appropriate ones for image creation. The aim is to generate the specified WebP images efficiently.


**Generating Image Variations**

I'm now generating initial image variations. The `generate_image` tool will produce base images that I can later refine. I plan to use ImageMagick to precisely resize and convert these into the specified WebP images. My focus now is on creating a series of images that can be adjusted using available tools to create the requested images of differing sizes. This will ensure I have a good starting point for achieving the requested specifications.


**Defining Image Parameters**

I've defined image parameters, including themes and target resolutions, as a foundation for image generation. I'm focusing on creating six contextually appropriate images using `generate_image` and `run_command` tools. Now, the main aim is to develop the first image that will become the starting point for image resizing and conversion to WebP format. I'm also ensuring the images align with the specified resolutions. I've begun to list out each image's properties for efficient generation.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now prioritizing direct tool usage as per the critical instructions. I am starting to explicitly list related tools before executing anything. My focus is now on avoiding the use of 'cat', and limiting generic tools like 'ls', 'grep', or 'sed', and on using specialized tools, like 'grep_search'. I'm also preparing to create a script for image optimization, specifically for resizing, compressing to WebP, and checking file sizes for various images, such as banners and promotional materials.

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Task Execution**

I'm now integrating stricter rules for tool usage, especially avoiding `cat` for file manipulation and `grep` inside bash commands. I'm focusing on more direct and efficient approaches. My primary goal is to use specialized tools where possible. I've also begun to think about how to best formulate my process so that I take all possible methods into consideration before making a call.
I'm beginning to consider a more complex process to perform image conversion, starting with loops and a focus on `convert` and `cwebp`.

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection criteria based on Critical Instructions 1 and 2. I'm focusing on avoiding `cat`, `grep` within bash commands, and inefficient tool pairings. Specifically, when working on `Acta_Aceptacion_Adenda_Sitio_Web.md`, I'm actively identifying the appropriate tools *before* execution to address the redundancy issue and maintain coherence.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

<bash_command_reminder>
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection criteria based on Critical Instructions 1 and 2. I'm focusing on avoiding `cat`, `grep` within bash commands, and other inefficient practices. This new method demands I explicitly list all applicable tools before execution, prioritizing the most specific ones. This has helped me narrow down the specific file location, which is `./portafolio-dev-2026/blocklabgd/v1.2/contrato/Acta_Aceptacion_Adenda_Sitio_Web.md`

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. I'm actively avoiding redundant commands within bash. My focus is always using the most specific tool for the job. Specifically, the "EN Acta_Aceptacion_Adenda_Sitio_Web.md" file has some redundant sections. I'll need to examine section 2 and section 3.


**Clarifying Document Sections**

I'm now clarifying the problematic sections of "EN Acta_Aceptacion_Adenda_Sitio_Web.md", specifically 2 and 3, which involve redundant language. I want to improve readability. I'll focus on removing that redundancy. I'll need to remove redundant information in sections 2 and 3, so that the document is simpler.


**Analyzing Adenda Structure**

I'm now analyzing the structure of the adenda, specifically regarding sections 2 and 3. The redundancy appears as though section 2 describes items, and section 3 repeats similar descriptions. The budget is clear, but the details are repetitive. I'm considering re-organizing to use section 3 as a reference to section 2. Another option is a brief intro in section 2, and details in section 3. Usually, the adenda lists features, and the financial section lists just the total.


**Revising Redundancy in Adenda**

I'm now revising the adenda to address redundancy, specifically between Sections 2 and 3 of "EN Acta_Aceptacion_Adenda_Sitio_Web.md." The user wants me to fix redundancy, and the context is that Section 2 describes added features. I need to keep the description in Section 2, but I'll focus on streamlining and refining the wording to prevent repetition with the financial details in Section 3. I'm focusing on "lo siguiente esta redundante... corrige de forma coherente al contexto del documento".


**Simplifying Adenda Section**

I'm now simplifying Section 3 to improve clarity. I'm moving away from listing the detailed items in Section 3. Instead, I'll focus on summarizing the features with the exact numbers. Now I need to decide the clearest way to indicate the relationship between Sections 2 and 3, given that the user pointed out redundancy in the list of the 4 items. It seems best to simply reference Section 2's detailed descriptions in the brief Section 3 summary. I need to retain the section's concise format. I must make Section 3 clear, concise, and non-repetitive of Section 2. The redundancy is the list of 4 items. So the user thinks the list of 4 items in section 2 is redundant because they are listed in section 3.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now prioritizing tool selection with greater precision, adhering strictly to the new rules I've established. Critical Instruction 1 and 2 are always top of mind. I'm actively avoiding `cat`, `grep`, `ls`, and `sed` in ways that violate my defined standards. For instance, I'm analyzing the tools I could use and the rationale for their selection. I'm focusing on the specifics of the tool choices.


**Clarifying Storage Requirements**

I'm now zeroing in on the file storage rules, specifically regarding contract-related PDFs. There's a rule about placing files in the `contrato/` subdirectory. I'm focusing on the specified file types and their appropriate locations. Also, I've noted a repetition in Section 3, and I'm updating it for clarity by reducing the redundancy present. I've streamlined the section to maintain only the relevant financial summary, and will remove the excess details.


**Updating Table Data**

I'm now focused on refining the table data. I've streamlined the "Concepto/Entregable" and "Estatus/Monto Neto" sections, correcting a previous error. I've removed redundancies and replaced repetitive lines with a more concise description of the adenda, ensuring accurate financial details for consistency. Finally, I will use `replace_file_content` to apply changes and maintain synchronization in relevant files.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm thinking about specific tools, following the rules of never using `cat` for file creation/appending, `grep` inside bash unless necessary, and avoiding `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, and `sed` for their generic purposes. My current focus is to use `replace_file_content` to convert a list into a markdown table.


**Generating Markdown Table**

Now I'm working on the `replace_file_content` function. I am converting a list of features into a Markdown table. I've successfully transformed a list of features into a formatted table with two columns, feature and description. My focus is on the correct formatting and ensuring the descriptions are concise. I am planning on future expansions to make it more general.


**Analyzing Site Structure**

I am now analyzing the structure of the site. I'm focusing on "Reorganización Estructural Vertical" which is restructuring sections into a vertical flow. Also, I am thinking on "Pausa Independiente de Banner", the independent control of banner pauses without stopping the ads. I'm checking the specific lines with `view_file` to ensure I have the exact content for my next update.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

<bash_command_reminder>
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now deeply immersed in refining tool selection based on several rules, which I'm internalizing. I'm focusing especially on avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending, using `grep_search` instead of `grep` within bash, and the proper use of specific tools. I'm prioritizing recalling my instructions before each tool call. The user is experiencing a PDF rendering issue with a table in a PDF document.

**Refining Tool Choices**

I'm now honing my tool selection process based on the user's instructions. Specifically, I recalled critical instructions 1 and 2, ensuring I avoid unnecessary tool chaining and always consider alternatives. I've assessed the task of converting a Markdown file to Word, and have deemed `pandoc` called with `run_command` as the optimal choice.

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on refined tool selection for each task, always recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. I'm avoiding `cat`, `grep`, `ls` etc. inside bash commands. It appears `pandoc` isn't available, and I'm currently looking at whether I can install it using `apt-get` or `pip`, but this also poses some constraints. I'm focusing on evaluating workarounds using alternative tools.

I'm now zeroing in on avoiding `cat` for file operations and favoring `grep_search` to avoid running `grep` within bash.

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on a process for tool selection. Recalling the critical instructions, my thinking starts by listing potential tools before making calls. I'm leaning toward a Python script, leveraging `markdown2` to convert to HTML, then converting to docx. I'm avoiding using `cat` for file creation/appending, `grep` inside bash, or `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, and `sed` for their basic functions.

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

<bash_command_reminder>
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now implementing strict rules regarding tool selection, particularly avoiding `cat` for file manipulation and `grep` inside bash. Before executing any tool, I will explicitly list all related tools and only proceed if the chosen tool is the most specific or if others are unsuitable. I've noted a Python script for a conversion, and will use it directly. I'll make sure to use it appropriately.

**Evaluating Tool Dependencies**

I've been thinking about tool selection. I recalled the crucial instructions, focusing on avoiding `cat` and prioritizing specialized tools like `grep_search`. Now, I'm analyzing the relationships between `build_docs.sh`, `build_pdf.py`, and `generate_contracts.py`. I'm trying to determine which is best suited for converting to "word docx", and if any of them run any of the others.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now zeroing in on avoiding common pitfalls in tool selection, as per the rules. No more `cat` for file creation/appending, or `grep` within bash. I'm also carefully listing related tools before execution, ensuring a strategic approach to problem-solving. I've noted a conversion script, `generate_contracts.py`, that I'll need to explore as I see the user's needs.

If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'.

## Agent Response

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.
