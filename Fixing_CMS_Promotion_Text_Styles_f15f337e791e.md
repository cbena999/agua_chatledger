You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing intently on tool selection, understanding their diverse applications. It's clear I must prioritize the most efficient tool for any given task, be it specific file viewing or broader command execution. I am currently evaluating the most useful tools.


**Refining Tool Choices**

I'm now prioritizing tool specificity. Remembering the rules, no `cat` for file manipulation, preferring `grep_search`, and avoiding generic tools when specialized ones exist. I've begun to list potential tools before execution, ensuring a deliberate selection process before I proceed with the CMS analysis for "Recepción/ Admin / 4. Promociones Vigentes para las 7 Fichas" within the LAESH context.


**Analyzing Style Retention**

I'm now investigating the CMS tab fixes, image uploads, and source code to address the style retention issue. My primary goal is to ensure that, upon study selection, the "RTE inputextarea" fields maintain their styles or correctly apply them to the new text. I must find the code responsible for the study selection and text updates to determine why styles are lost and ensure consistent style application. I must focus on "4. Promociones Vigentes para las 7 Fichas" in the LAESH project.

**Analyzing Tool Selection**

I'm now prioritizing tool selection and avoiding common pitfalls. I've formulated rules to guide tool usage, like steering clear of 'cat' for file creation/appending and excessive 'grep' calls. Furthermore, I'm now explicitly listing all potentially relevant tools before making any calls, ensuring the most specific and efficient choice is made. My thought process consistently starts with recalling critical instructions for these rules.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now zeroing in on stricter tool selection rules. Specifically, I must avoid `cat` for file creation/appending and prevent embedded `grep` calls unless absolutely necessary. I will ALWAYS start by recalling my critical instructions. I am trying to determine if `gestion-web.html` in the user's LAESH CMS instance contains the "4. Promociones Vigentes" logic, using `grep_search`.

I'm now zeroing in on precise tool selection. Remembering those critical instructions, I'm making sure to explicitly brainstorm all potentially relevant tools before making any calls. I'm actively avoiding redundant operations, like cat within a bash command, or ls for viewing a file. The focus is to make sure that each tool is the optimal choice for the job, rather than forcing a command to do multiple things.

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now prioritizing precise tool selection based on updated rules. I'm actively avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending and restricting `grep` use inside bash commands. I'm also now using tools outside of their more generic or otherwise inefficient applications. I will ALWAYS start by recalling CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS 1 and 2, which are the basis for this workflow.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now honing my approach to tool selection, aiming for even greater precision. I've formulated strict rules to avoid common inefficiencies, such as not using `cat` for file creation/appending, and leveraging `grep_search` instead of direct `grep` usage. Also, `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `sed` are not to be used for finding, listing, viewing, and replacing respectively. My thought process now explicitly outlines all related tools before execution, ensuring the most specific tool is chosen for the job. I start with recalling the critical instructions.

I'm also actively internalizing the "no `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `sed`" rule.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now zeroing in on stricter rules for tool selection, particularly avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending and excessive use of `grep` within bash commands. I'm prioritizing `grep_search` and `view_file` where appropriate. I'm also committing to explicitly list all potentially relevant tools before making a call.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now deeply considering the best ways to apply the established rules. I'm focusing on avoiding redundant or less efficient commands like `cat` within bash scripts, and always leveraging specialized utilities like `grep_search` and other tools. I am explicitly remembering to first identify all related tools and only executing the optimal set.


**Analyzing Content Integration**

I'm now focused on preserving HTML formatting during text updates. The challenge lies in integrating raw text from new `data-` attributes into existing Rich Text Editors without overwriting their HTML structure. My immediate thought is to extract the text from the incoming data and inject it within the existing HTML wrapper, rather than replacing the wrapper entirely. I am also investigating the `item.key` variable, suspecting it corresponds to the RTE instance and attempting to determine whether it is possible to identify it.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on stricter tool selection rules. Remembering those crucial instructions, I'm aiming to avoid `cat`, `grep` within commands, and `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `sed` when there are better choices. Before any tool call, I'm explicitly listing related tools and only executing a set if others are less suitable. For example, considering the RTE fields in `gestion-web.html`, I must determine the best tool to use.

I'm now examining the JavaScript code in `gestion-web.js` to understand how the variables `nombre`, `categoria`, `ayuno`, `tiempo`, and `detalle` are handled. These variables seem linked to specific data fields on the page. The use of `setData` suggests a potential connection to rich text editors, which is something I need to keep in mind, and verify if it influences the RTE fields in `gestion-web.html`. I'll analyze how these are handled to get more context.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. Remembering my instructions, I'm avoiding `cat`, `ls`, `grep`, and `sed` unless absolutely necessary. I need to explicitly list potential tools before execution, choosing only the most appropriate. I've located the relevant PHP file and the CKEditor initialization script. The issue is focused on `gestion-web`.


**Analyzing Style Preservation**

I'm now grappling with style preservation in the CKEditor update. The `setData()` method overwrites existing styles when updating the editor content based on the study selection. I need to figure out how to merge the new text with the existing styling in CKEditor 5. The key is to replace the old text while maintaining the HTML wrappers and inline styling.


**Investigating Text Replacement**

I'm now investigating text replacement techniques within CKEditor 5. I realize simply using `setData()` is insufficient, as expected. I'm considering several approaches. One involves parsing existing HTML and replacing text nodes, although the complexity of multiple nodes presents a challenge. Another approach utilizes CKEditor's model API to retain attributes during text insertion. However, because it's a CMS, I will read the HTML, extract the inner text, and wrap the new text with the previous HTML structure.



**Simplifying HTML Manipulation**

I've realized a significantly easier approach for HTML manipulation. Instead of complex parsing or DOM traversal, I'll leverage simpler methods within the HTML. The core idea is to retrieve the `innerHTML`, identify the text, and replace it. CKEditor 5 offers an even simpler path: select all content, copy the attributes from the first text node, delete the selection, and insert the updated text, preserving styles and structure.


**Evaluating Text Node Extraction**

I'm now evaluating text node extraction using either CKEditor's model API or direct HTML manipulation. I'm exploring accessing existing attributes, especially from the first text node, for preservation during updates. The alternative, string manipulation, is proving too brittle, even with the proposed regex replacement. My immediate focus is determining if the structure supports simpler HTML-based element extraction, which might simplify style preservation significantly.


**Implementing Text Insertion**

I'm now implementing the text insertion. I've been examining the proposed JavaScript function and simplifying its design. This function uses a temporary `div` to parse HTML. It aims to locate the deepest element, replacing its `textContent` with the new text while preserving the existing structure, including inline styles. It works smoothly with nested elements and handles cases where there are no children. The remaining question is how to use it with the CKEditor API.


**Optimizing Element Selection**

I'm now refining the element selection within the HTML update function. I've realized a potential issue with multiple top-level elements like multiple paragraphs. If the old HTML is not empty and consists of multiple elements, the function should replace the *entire* inner HTML, not just the text of the first element. I'm focusing on handling these cases robustly, ensuring that the updated HTML reflects the intended replacement across all elements, preserving the general styles.

The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.

I'm now zeroing in on optimizing tool selection. I've integrated stricter rules to avoid common pitfalls like using `cat` inside bash and inefficient `grep` usage. My focus is on making choices that maximize efficiency and that will result in more organized responses. I'm actively thinking through the tools that would be required for all stages of a task.


**Planning Implementation Strategies**

I'm currently focused on formulating a clear implementation plan. The goal is to address the issue of style loss when updating CKEditor instances. Instead of directly writing the code, I'm leaning toward creating an `implementation_plan.md` artifact. This would offer a concise analysis, and then seek feedback before implementation, and would avoid possible errors in the code.

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now honing my tool selection process based on two critical instructions. First, I recall the rules: no `cat` for file creation/appending, `grep_search` is preferred, and avoid generic tools like `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, and `sed` unless essential. Secondly, before tool calls, I'll list related tools to ensure I choose the most suitable options. The user wants to know if the text styles persist in the database.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now incorporating specific rules to refine my tool selection process. I'm focusing on avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending, preferring `grep_search` to embedded `grep` commands, and generally avoiding `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, and `sed` for their basic functionalities. I am also remembering to explicitly list all potentially relevant tools before making a tool call. I'm trying to identify how text styling is stored for each study.


**Investigating Content Structure**

I'm now investigating the structure of promotional content within the database, specifically focusing on how individual study descriptions are organized. It seems the main "Promociones Vigentes" text has entries with sub-sections for each day of the week. I need to determine where the catalog of all studies resides, potentially in the `estudios` or `catalogo_estudios` tables, to answer the user's question about text styling persistence. I am checking if there is any HTML in the value_texto column for these sections within the web_contenidos table.

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now implementing strict rules regarding tool selection, particularly avoiding `cat` for file creation and `grep` within bash. My focus is on direct, more efficient tools. I'm working to systematically list potential tools for each task before execution, ensuring a deliberate and optimal choice. I'm recalling the importance of the critical instructions.


**Analyzing Data Structure**

My focus has shifted to the `web_contenidos` table and how it handles data, specifically the `promo_titulo` field and its interaction with CKEditor. I'm investigating whether the backend stores HTML directly from the editor within `valor_texto`. I need to understand this to determine how styling is preserved or handled during data storage and retrieval. I am particularly curious about the implications of the backend's data handling when saving and retrieving the data entered from the form with the `promo_titulo` values.


**Investigating CMS Data Handling**

I'm now zeroing in on how the CMS specifically handles data input from CKEditor. My recent findings suggest the system directly stores CKEditor-generated HTML in the `web_contenidos` table. The plain text I observed in a previous dump now makes sense; it likely reflects instances where no styling was applied, or the dump was taken before styling was applied. Examining `gestion_web.php` confirmed this, with the field naming convention `promo_titulo_<?= $pId ?>` indicating the persistence of HTML input. I'm focusing on validating this through a combination of observations.


**Confirming Style Persistence**

I've confirmed that the `web_contenidos` table definitely stores HTML. I'm now certain the style applied to promotion day entries is persisted. I'm focusing on the interaction between the combo box and CKEditor. The raw study data is pulled when a study is selected, potentially overwriting any existing HTML styling, as I see it now. I'm understanding this is what gives each promotion day its individual style. The catalog itself does not have HTML. I am confident that the style is preserved in the table.

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing intently on tool selection, understanding their diverse applications. It's clear I must prioritize the most efficient tool for any given task, be it specific file viewing or broader command execution. I am currently evaluating the most useful tools.


**Refining Tool Choices**

I'm now deeply immersed in refining my tool selection process, adhering strictly to the principle of specificity. I'm actively avoiding redundant use of commands. I'm focusing on the explicit listing of relevant tools before execution, and only executing the optimal tool set. My focus is now on editing the file `/home/carlos/GitHub/caelitandem_home/restaurantb/www/laesh-web-assets-uipv1a/js/gestion-web.js`. I am reviewing the target content for replacement.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on precise tool choices. Recall: I should never use `cat` inside a Bash command to make or append files, and always use `grep_search` where appropriate. Plus, never use `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, or `sed` for those particular tasks. Before running tools, I need to list them all first. For my next action, I'm using `replace_file_content` to modify a JavaScript file.


**Analyzing Code Transformation**

I'm now deeply analyzing this new code block. My goal is to add functionality from the old block to the new one. I intend to use `replace_file_content` to replace the old code block, incorporating the new enhancements to maintain functionality while improving clarity and maintainability. This will involve breaking down the logic and ensuring each section has its proper place.


**Evaluating Code Extraction**

I'm now thoroughly evaluating this new code extraction and identifying its role in the larger system. My aim is to extract the relevant snippets from the old code block, and integrate it into the new code in an efficient manner. Using the tools I have, I am confident I can do this and keep all functionality.

Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Analyzing Tool Usage**

I'm now prioritizing tool selection with a strict set of rules. I'm actively avoiding 'cat' for file creation/appending and 'grep' within bash commands. I am also avoiding other similar common but less efficient utilities. I must recall that I need to list all tools relevant to a task before executing a set of tools. I am now applying this new mindset to analyze the new issues.


**Assessing Feature Viability**

I'm now deep-diving into the CKEditor 5 configuration. There's a styling issue with the "ck-promo-day" field; the preview and publication are also broken. Additionally, I need to modify the font size and font family options in the toolbar. The current configuration uses descriptive words and lacks numerical font sizes, and specific font names. The task is to analyze the feasibility of changing font sizes and font families, without making any alterations yet.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now implementing strict rules regarding tool selection, particularly avoiding `cat` for file manipulation and emphasizing `grep_search`. I'm also now pre-emptively listing all relevant tools before executing any. I'm actively thinking before any action, and evaluating the relative merits of any given tool to a more specialized option. I am ensuring that the correct tool is selected for each job, according to a list of specified rules. I will be reviewing the tool selection for the task at hand.

I'm now zeroing in on more precise tool selection. Remembering the critical instructions, I’m building a mental checklist of related tools before executing anything. This includes avoiding `cat` in specific contexts and leveraging `grep_search` whenever feasible. This ensures I'm picking the most appropriate tool for each step, and not using some tools in a manner that's not optimal.

<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

**Analyzing Tool Selection**

I've been refining my approach to tool selection based on those critical instructions. I'm actively avoiding redundant commands within bash. My focus is now on meticulously listing all potential tools for a task before executing any. I'm also double-checking frontend file paths, and making sure the information that I need is as accurate as possible.

**Refining Efficiency Guidelines**

I've been refining my approach to tool selection based on those critical instructions, particularly avoiding `cat` for file creation/appending and excessive use of `grep` within bash commands. I am also recalling the importance of first explicitly listing all potential tools before executing. For example, I'm thinking about the correct tools to use for processing array data, especially concerning the `$draftRow` and `$promos` arrays, to maximize efficiency.

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.

The following is an <EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE> not actually sent by the user. It is provided by the system as a set of reminders and general important information to pay attention to. Do NOT respond to this message, just act accordingly.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

<bash_command_reminder>
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: ...
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: ...'.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection protocols. Considering Critical Instructions 1 and 2, I'm avoiding `cat`, internal `grep`, and `ls` for their specific functions. Now, I'm focusing on directly identifying the "promociones" rendering in `index.php`. My search aims to pinpoint the exact code block handling the promotions.

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection criteria as I'm analyzing `website/index.php`. Remember those critical instructions? I am keeping them in mind. The new rule is to explicitly list all potentially related tools *before* executing a set. Now, I'm using `grep_search` to pinpoint the rendering of "Promociones" within the main file, a much more targeted approach than I had previously considered.

**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection criteria based on Critical Instructions 1 and 2. I'm focusing on avoiding `cat`, `grep` within bash commands, and inefficient tool pairings. I've identified the front-end files: `gestion-web.html` and `gestion-web.js`. Now, I'm examining how to apply this to the text style of the "RTE de Título / Etiqueta Superior de la Ficha" section.

**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now zeroing in on avoiding `cat` for file manipulation, and favoring more specific tools like `grep_search`. I'm also actively remembering to consider the full range of relevant tools before making a choice, ensuring that each decision is based on a thoughtful review of available options. I'm scrutinizing instances where generic tools might be used when more specialized alternatives exist.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Refining Tool Usage**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection rules to boost efficiency, avoiding common pitfalls like using `cat` needlessly. I'm prioritizing `grep_search` and other specialized tools over generic shell commands. Before executing, I'm carefully listing related tools, executing a set only after ruling out alternatives. This focused approach is being applied even to simple PHP code, like extracting `$diaNombre`.


**Analyzing Tag Removal**

I've discovered that both `gestion_web.php` and `promociones.php` employ `strip_tags` on `$p['dia_semana']`, which is a key observation. To address the issue, I need to remove this function call from both files. Specifically, I've identified the problematic textarea in `gestion_web.php` and determined that removing `strip_tags` within it will solve the problem in the frontend, but I'll make sure there are not unintended consequences within that file. I am also checking all instances of the variable in the code.


**Evaluating Output Format**

Now, I'm carefully evaluating the output format of `$diaNombre` within `promociones.php`. I've realized its HTML content, originating from the RTE, needs raw output to preserve formatting. This raw output avoids unwanted HTML escaping. I'm focusing on ensuring data integrity while considering various input scenarios in this file. I have identified the need to refine this PHP code.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now zeroing in on stricter tool selection rules. Remembering those critical instructions is key! I'm actively avoiding redundant tool nesting – no `cat` inside bash, no generic `grep` usage. I'm also now pre-planning potential tools before execution, ensuring the chosen set is the most specific. I'm looking at how `_createEditorNoMedia` and `_createEditor` are defined to see why the font size is missing.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Analyzing Tool Selection**

I've been refining my approach to tool selection based on those critical instructions. I'm actively avoiding redundant commands within bash and prioritizing specialized tools like `grep_search`. I'm now explicitly listing related tools before any execution, ensuring I choose the most suitable option. Recently, I was examining `ckeditor-init.js` and have been prioritizing specific tools.


**Considering Font Size Options**

I'm now contemplating how to integrate numerical font sizes into the CKEditor 5 configuration. The existing setup uses word-based sizes; the challenge is whether to add numerical sizes, replace the existing options array with numerical sizes, or both. I am considering replacing the default options with numerical values to align with the user's explicit preference for standard numerical sizes.

<EPHEMERAL_MESSAGE>
<planning_mode>
You're in planning mode. Exercise judgement on whether the user's last request warrants a plan and take action accordingly.
If the user's request warrants a plan then follow this workflow:
1. Research first before taking actions. Do not use your code editing tools or run modifying commands during this time.
2. Create an implementation plan artifact with `request_feedback = true` to request approval. Include any open questions for the user directly in the implementation plan. Don't use the ask_question tool to ask these questions. Stop calling tools and allow the user to review the plan and provide feedback or approval.
3. After receiving approval, begin execution. Create and update the task artifact as you work.
4. Verify any work that you have done.
5. Create a walkthrough artifact to present your work to the user. When writing artifacts, make sure to follow the artifact formatting guidelines and use github alerts to highlight critical sections.
If the user's request does NOT warrant a plan then continue your work WITHOUT making a plan or requesting user feedback.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 1: You may have access to a variety of tools at your disposal. Some tools may be for a specific task such as 'view_file' (for viewing contents of a file). Others may be very broadly applicable such as the ability to run a command on a terminal. Always prioritize using the most specific tool you can for the task at hand. Here are some rules: (a) NEVER run cat inside a bash command to create a new file or append to an existing file. (b) ALWAYS use grep_search instead of running grep inside a bash command unless absolutely needed. (c) DO NOT use ls for listing, cat for viewing, grep for finding, sed for replacing. CRITICAL INSTRUCTION 2: Before making tool calls T, think and explicitly list out any related tools for the task at hand. You can only execute a set of tools T if all other tools in the list are either more generic or cannot be used for the task at hand. ALWAYS START your thought with recalling critical instructions 1 and 2. In particular, the format for the start of your thought block must be '...94>thought

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Specific Tools**

I'm focusing on the importance of selecting the most appropriate tool for each task. The goal is to maximize efficiency. I am making an active effort to ensure that I always choose the correct approach to each problem or challenge, such as choosing a relevant 'view_file' utility where possible.


**Analyzing Tool Limitations**

I am now delving into tool usage limitations. Remembering the rules, especially about avoiding `cat` for file creation and `grep` inside bash commands, is paramount. I'm focusing on pre-planning the tools required, ensuring I list all related utilities before executing. Additionally, I am addressing an issue where HTML tags are stripped from a specific label in PHP, meaning styling applied through CKEditor is lost on save or rendering.


**Implementing HTML Adjustments**

I've made progress on removing `strip_tags` in specific PHP files (`gestion_web.php` and `promociones.php`) to retain CKEditor styling. However, I've kept it for `dia_semana` due to URL and data attribute integrity. I'm also working on enhancing the CKEditor configuration in `ckeditor-init.js`. I am adding numeric font sizes and additional standard fonts to the dropdowns in the editor, in both `_createEditor` and `_createEditorNoMedia`.

### Thinking

**Prioritizing Tool Usage**

I'm focusing on the most efficient tool utilization. It's becoming clearer that prioritizing specific tools will drastically improve my problem-solving ability. The goal is to always select the tool best suited for the immediate task at hand, regardless of how broad a command may be. This will keep work on the project organized.


**Refining Tool Selection**

I'm now implementing strict tool selection criteria as per the guidelines. I'm focusing on avoiding `cat` for file manipulation and emphasizing `grep_search` instead of embedded `grep`. I am also applying rules for what tools to avoid. Before execution, I must also explicitly list relevant tools, validating their appropriateness. I'm taking the feedback into account, and focusing on an analysis of impacts before changes, starting with `strip_tags()`.


**Analyzing `strip_tags()` Impact**

I'm now diving into the impact analysis for removing `strip_tags()` from `dia_semana`. My focus is on understanding why it was originally included. Examining `promociones.php` and `gestion_web.php` reveals the function's use in various contexts. Specifically, the display and handling of day names and their presentation in the CMS are being considered for potential implications of removal.


**Evaluating HTML Handling**

I'm now carefully examining the implications of allowing HTML in `dia_semana`. I've revisited the potential scenarios in the existing code. While `$diaLabel` and image placeholders appear safe, the rendering in `sections/promociones.php` raises a concern. Rendering HTML directly within the `catalog-card-day` div might cause layout issues. This is the area requiring the most attention, since changes can cause UI disruptions.
